G20 governments provided at least USD 168 billion in public financial support for renewable power in 2023, less than one third of G20 fossil fuel subsidies that year. Advanced G20 economies and China accounted for 95% of renewable power support. Where disaggregated data was available, support was directed mostly to solar and wind, but almost half of the support targeted multiple technologies or did not specify.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming current investment and support patterns remain consistent to 2030, we estimate that public support may need to double to around USD 336 billion per year to achieve the pledge made at the 28th UN Climate Change Conference (COP 28) to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. This would still be lower than current G20 fossil fuel subsidies (USD 535 billion in 2023). Lower income countries are at risk of getting left behind in the clean energy transition and will need grants and concessional finance to catch up. The benefits of increasing support to renewable power extend beyond achieving climate goals: increased energy access and less air pollution, price volatility, and geopolitical risk relative to fossil fuels.\\\\n\\\\nRelated\\\\n-------\\\\n\\\\n*   [### Mapping India\\'s Energy Policy 2023 Report March 11, 2024](https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/mapping-india-energy-policy-2023 \\\\\"Mapping India&#039;s Energy Policy 2023\\\\\")\\\\n*   [### Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker](https://fossilfuelsubsidytracker.org/ \\\\\"Links\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nShare this page:\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20 \\\\\"Share via BlueSky\\\\\")\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20&title=Public%20Financial%20Support%20for%20Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20and%20Integration%20in%20the%20G20%20Countries \\\\\"Share via Linkedin\\\\\")\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Public%20Financial%20Support%20for%20Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20and%20Integration%20in%20the%20G20%20Countries&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20&via=iisd_news \\\\\"Share via X\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nParticipating experts\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\n[#### Tara Laan Lead, Incentivizing Renewables](https://www.iisd.org/people/tara-laan \\\\\"Find out more about Tara Laan\\\\\")[#### Nhat Do Policy Analyst](https://www.iisd.org/people/nhat-do \\\\\"Find out more about Nhat Do\\\\\")[#### Steven Haig Policy Advisor](https://www.iisd.org/people/steven-haig \\\\\"Find out more about Steven Haig\\\\\")[#### Indira Urazova Policy Advisor](https://www.iisd.org/people/indira-urazova \\\\\"Find out more about Indira Urazova\\\\\")[#### Eduardo Posada Policy Analyst](https://www.iisd.org/people/eduardo-posada \\\\\"Find out more about Eduardo Posada\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nReport details\\\\n--------------\\\\n\\\\nTopic[Climate Change Mitigation](https://www.iisd.org/topics/climate-change-mitigation)[Energy](https://www.iisd.org/topics/energy)[Governance and Multilateral Agreements](https://www.iisd.org/topics/governance-and-multilateral-agreements)[Just Transition](https://www.iisd.org/topics/just-transition)[Subsidies](https://www.iisd.org/topics/subsidies)Focus area[Climate](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/climate)[Act Together](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/act-together)[Economies](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/economies)Publisher IISD Copyright IISD, 2024\\\\n\\\\nYou might also be interested in\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n[### Advancing a Fair and Funded Transition Away from Fossil Fuels This briefing outlines recommendations for countries to advance the transition away from fossil fuels at SB 62 in Bonn and COP 30 in Belem.

NDCs and renewable energy targets in 2023: Tripling renewable power by 2030\\\\n\\\\n#### Newsletter\\\\n\\\\nGo\\\\n\\\\nThis report reviews renewable energy targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement as of the end of October 2023, ahead of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), and assesses their level of ambition against IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario and the goal of tripling renewables in the power sector by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nFor developing countries, the report identifies those targets that are conditional on financial assistance and determines the minimum level of financing needed to support their achievement. It also examines the extent to which renewable energy targets in NDCs are aligned with those set out in national plans and policies, and whether these are reflected in laws, policies or roadmaps and plans.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that renewable energy ambitions within NDCs are not only insufficient, but also fall short of what countries have committed to in domestic policies that exist outside the framework of the Paris Agreement (national laws, policies, roadmaps, plans, strategies). As per IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway, and the COP28 pledge to triple renewable power globally, renewable power generation capacity in the G20 countries alone would need to grow from less than 3 terawatts (TW) in 2022 to 9.4 TW by 2030, accounting for 80% of the global total. The commitments made in NDCs account for less than half of that required to align with the tripling renewables pledge, and those made in national energy plans and policies fall short by 30%. The report also notes that developing countries – mainly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) – plan to double their renewable installed capacity, compared to 2022, to more than 110 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. However, more than half of this is conditional on international support in the form of financing, technical assistance, technology transfer or capacity building.\\\\n\\\\nRelated content\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\n*   ![Image 4](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/May/Renewable-Energy-Projects-in-Central-Asia-Tile.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=00BD908FDCBCDDE06B371751E3E415BC)[### IRENA Issues Call for Renewable Energy Projects in Central Asia](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/May/IRENA-Issues-Call-for-Renewable-Energy-Projects-in-Central-Asia)26 May 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 5](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/May/I-ACT-Youth-Capacity-tile.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=4CF6433A740EBDECD21B3EEEAED675E2)[### I ACT: Building Youth’s Capacity Through Peer-to-Peer Learning](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/May/I-ACT-Building-Youths-Capacity-Through-Peer-to-Peer-Learning)20 May 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 6](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/Jun/IIW-Wrap-Up-Article-Tile-Image.png?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=0742F0A8E76D6B82469D5DF9B0032BDC)[### Five Key Takeaways from the IRENA Innovation Week 2025](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/Jun/Innovation-Week-2025-Wrap-Up)16 June 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 7](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Press-Release/2025/Jun/GCEP-release-tile.png?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=833798202338C649E3C2C3F13285897E)[### IRENA and Brazil to Host First Global Energy Planning Summit](https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jun/IRENA-and-Brazil-to-Host-First-Global-Energy-Planning-Summit)2 June 2025[Press Releases](https://www.irena.org/Search?contentType=8632933e-7fb6-4dbe-8407-fe1354cdc20d&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 8](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Blog/2025/May/Extreme-weather-and-renewables.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=825301013F07368184465BF8CB438E56)[### Strategies for Resilience -

Two-thirds of the countries around the world have enacted [...] governments are committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy and to attracting investment in the renewable energy sector. Despite reiterated commitments on major international forums to discontinue these inefficient subsidies (box 11), the global level of support in 2021 remained similar to that of 2010, totalling over $500 billion.8 In 2022, according to IEA estimates, global fossil fuel subsidies doubled from the previous year to an all-time high of $1 trillion (IEA, 2023).

INVESTMENT POLICIES FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES H I G H L I G H T S • UNCTAD\\'s World Investment Report 2023 highlights a worrisome increase in the SDG investment gap, surpassing $4 trillion annually in developing countries alone, with energy investment needs estimated at $2.2 trillion per year. Successful energy transition necessitates significant investment in renewable energy projects, the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions. At the recent World Investment Forum (WIF), global stakeholders emphasized the need to redirect net-zero finance toward developing economies. • Existing policy frameworks aimed at promoting investment in the energy transition are notably inadequate, especially in poorer nations. Around the world, two-thirds of countries have adopted renewable energy policies. However, only half of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and one-third of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have done so. While developed and emerging economies have integrated private investment promotion mechanisms into over 70 per cent of their renewable energy policies, the same holds true for only 24 per cent of policies in LDCs and 17 per cent of those in SIDS. • While most developed economies use targeted investment promotion policies, many developing countries use generic tax incentives – applicable to investment in any industry – that do not address the specificities of energy investment projects. In recent times, auctions and tenders for renewable energy projects have gained traction across all country groups. • The value of fossil fuel subsidies has reached a staggering $1 trillion, far surpassing support for renewable energy. Gradually phasing out these subsidies, although complex for many countries, would incentivize investments in renewables. • Policies to encourage the phased retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure are also needed, as emphasized during the WIF. However, thermal power plants will continue to play a role in ensuring energy security for many countries in the years to come. To curb their environmental impact, broader adoption of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, cofiring, and low-carbon fuels is key. At present, policies and initiatives to promote investment in such technologies are predominantly confined to developed countries and large emerging economies. • The Global Action Compact for Investment in Sustainable Energy for All, proposed by UNCTAD in the World Investment Report 2023, aims to address these challenges and achieve a balanced energy transition. It emphasizes three key objectives: achieving climate targets, ensuring affordable energy access for all, and maintaining energy security. NOVEMBER 2023 ISSUE 26 2 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Introduction Climate change is an existential threat to human society. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that the world is likely to reach global warming of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels within 15 years unless we achieve drastic cuts in carbon emissions now. This would result in large-scale drought, famine, heat stress, species die-off, loss of entire ecosystems and habitable land, throwing more than 100 million into poverty (IPCC, 2022a). The experts, however, have also pointed out that we have the technologies and policy tools to achieve climate change mitigation, but solutions should be scaled up rapidly (IPCC, 2022b). For this to happen, the policy response should be commensurate with the challenge. The energy system is at the centre of the policy response to climate change and national policies are crucial for driving the shift towards clean energy. The clean energy transition needs to accelerate, while at the same time, energy access needs to expand significantly. In this context, emerging and developing economies, in particular, are faced with the dual challenge of ensuring energy security and meeting the growing energy needs of their expanding population, while simultaneously speeding up mitigation solutions and cutting carbon emissions. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, international investment in renewable energy has nearly tripled. However, this growth has predominantly occurred in developed countries. According to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2023, the investment gap across all SDG sectors has increased from $2.5 trillion in 2015 to more than $4 trillion per year today. The largest gaps are in energy, water, and transport infrastructure. Energy investment needs in developing countries are estimated at $2.2 trillion per year (WIR23). Figure 1: Key technologies of the clean energy transition of the power sector Source: UNCTAD 3 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M As discussed during various sessions of the UNCTAD World Investment Forum (WIF) 2023, in parallel with this big push for investment in renewable energy, the clean energy transition will require the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions (box 1). These solutions integrate environmental technologies to decrease CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants, such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies, the use of clean fuels, as well as technologies that increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants (figure 1). Box 1: The Climate Finance and Investment Track at the World Investment Forum The 8th edition of UNCTAD’s World Investment Forum (WIF) took place in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October 2023, and saw the convergence of 8,000 participants, including government officials, international organizations, policymakers, 700 CEOs and investors, sovereign wealth funds, sustainable stock exchanges and key capital markets actors. The WIF featured a dedicated Climate Finance and Investment Track, which included the second COP28 preparatory Global Dialogue and several Investment Focused Events, to continue the preparation of decisions for adoption at COP28, with a particular focus on climate finance and investment. The Global Dialogues and Investment Focused Events were agreed by the Parties at COP27 with the aim to identify challenges, barriers and roadblocks in accelerating the just energy transition; develop actionable solutions and innovations for policies, institutional arrangements, finance and technologies; and explore opportunities to direct finance flows towards the implementation of mitigation projects on the ground. Some of the issues discussed during the WIF in this track included: • Net zero finance and financing the just energy transition; • Carbon markets; • FDI, hydrogen and the greening of emerging markets; • Strategic minerals for decarbonization; • Stock exchange action on climate disclosure; • The role of trade and investment policies in promoting climate action and boosting NDCs implementation; • Financial instruments for early retirement of fossil-fuel-assets; • Sustainable infrastructure. Source: UNCTAD While recognizing that a well-designed regulatory framework that comprehensively addresses the legal, regulatory and institutional aspects is a key determinant of investment in the clean energy transition (figure 2), this Investment Policy Monitor focuses on some of the main incentives and disincentives to clean energy investment. It expands on the findings and analysis presented in the World Investment Report 2023: Investing in sustainable energy for all (WIR23) and further draws from the insights and the discussion at the WIF. First, it reviews and analyses renewable energy policies around the world and identifies the key policy tools utilized by countries in different regions and at different levels of development to promote investment in renewables (section 1). Second, it provides an overview of existing clean energy transition policies in technologies and fuels that would allow the decarbonization of the traditional power sector (section 2). Third, it highlights trends in the evolution of fossil fuel subsidies around the world, which represent a disincentive to the promotion of investment in clean electricity generation (section 3). Finally, it highlights the main findings and policy implications (section 4). 4 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 2: Key policy determinants of investment in the clean energy sector Source: UNCTAD 1. Renewable energy policies – a review of key investment incentives a. The universe of renewable energy policies Although the cost of renewable energy (especially wind and solar) has fallen substantially in the last decade, increasing its competitiveness in comparison to fossil fuel generation technologies (IRENA, 2022), risks and barriers to renewable energy investment remain, which hamper their development, especially in emerging and developing economies (box 2). Power generation technologies based on renewable energy typically require higher upfront investment than those based on fossil fuel. The cost of capital thus represents a higher importance in the investment decision. Given the intrinsic connection between the cost of capital and risks, this cost varies between countries and tends to be higher in emerging and developing economies. De-risking investment in renewables allows the cost of capital to decrease and thus enables renewable energy projects to better compete financially with fossil fuel generation technologies, especially in emerging and developing countries, where the cost of capital is higher (Polzin et al., 2021; Bachner, Mayer and Steininger, 2019). In this context, policies and regulatory frameworks can lower investment risks, promote the deployment of renewable energy generation technologies and help better correlate renewable energy potential with private investment. 5 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M The universe of renewable energy policies is complex, as countries adopt various laws, policies, and regulations depending on their legal and regulatory systems.1 Based on the review of 798 renewable energy policies, covering 192 economies, this section analyses investment promotion instruments and incentives used around the world to foster private investment in renewable energy sectors. Two-thirds of the countries around the world have enacted policies and laws specifically dedicated to renewable energy, but all countries have at least incorporated some aspects of renewable energy regulations or promotion into energy laws, energy and climate change strategies, electricity acts, or national development plans. In contrast, only 33 per cent of SIDS and 54 per cent of LDCs have laws specifically addressing renewable energy. Policies on renewable energy typically focus on three main policy aspects: regulation, private investment promotion, and public investment measures (figure 3). Figure 3: Policy aspects addressed in renewable energy policies, by type and category of countries (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Regulation encompasses a wide range of policies, including licensing and permitting systems, land access, industry structure, and renewable energy-specific aspects like priority access to the grid (figure 2). They also include general policies and strategies aimed at achieving emission reduction targets or promoting access to energy that align with climate goals or the energy-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). Such policies provide long-term vision and certainty, which are crucial for attracting investment. Private investment promotion policies include all types of incentives and risk reduction mechanisms aiming to attract investment to the sector. They will be further analyzed below. Public investment measures include direct investment by the State in generation capacities, through public enterprises and PPPs, as well as direct investment in research and development (R&D) in the sector. The use of these three policy aspects varies across country groups. While two thirds of developed economies prioritize improving the regulatory framework and promoting private investment in their renewable energy policies, only 24 per cent of LDCs and 25 per cent of SIDS do the same. Similarly, private investment promotion is a policy focus for over 75 per cent of developed countries, but only less than 30 per cent of LDCs and SIDS (figure 3). About a third of developed and developing economies emphasize on the role of public investment but only 22 per cent of LDCs and SIDS do the same. 1 See for instance, the “G20 Compendium on promoting investment for sustainable development”, prepared by UNCTAD under the guidance of the Indonesian Presidency of the G20, and with inputs from all G20 members and some associated countries, September 2022. https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/publications/1272/g20-compendium-on-promoting-investment-for-sustainable-development 6 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 2: Risks and barriers to investing in renewable energy generation In addition to the risks and barriers affecting all investment, such as macro-economic and political instability, renewable energy investment faces a range of specific risks and challenges. These include: Policy uncertainty The policy stability and the longer-term perspective are shown to be of particular importance in investment decisions (Criscuolo and Menon, 2015; Hafner, James and Jones, 2019), as the capital intensity of renewables usually implies a longer payback period and thus a higher need for policy stability to ensure positive return on investment. In Germany, for example, while Feed-in tariffs and other incentives to the sector have been crucial (Gawel, Strunz and Lehmann, 2016), their effectiveness has consistently decreased when policy uncertainty has increased (Agnolucci, 2006). Sector regulations Regulatory aspects of the renewable energy sector such as access to the grid are a critical determinant of FDI in the sector (Keeley and Ikeda, 2017; Mahbud et al., 2022; Ragosa and Warren, 2019). The energy market structures, regulations and governance, including the dispute resolution mechanisms, need to be clearly set to not be perceived as a risk for investors (e.g. vertical integration, the efficiency of licensing and permitting procedures; effectiveness of governing bodies, rule of law etc.). Moreover, regulations that favour fossil fuel industries are still in place in many countries which undermines the comparative advantage of renewable energy technologies (section 3). Electricity infrastructure Solar and wind represent a large share of the newly installed capacity today, but they are intermittent, depending on weather conditions. The integration of intermittent and more decentralized sources of energy requires higher flexibility of the grid and investment in storage systems. Grid flexibility depends on several factors, such as the balancing systems, generation capacities, storage options, and grid intelligence (smart grid). Moreover, the transmission and distribution networks are crucial for grid flexibility because a larger network makes it easier to transport energy from areas with excess capacity to areas with higher demand. Thus, the integration of renewable energy capacities depends on the investment made in transmission and distribution networks. Technology Renewable energy technologies have been available for some time, but their large-scale adoption is still relatively new, and there may be concerns about their long-term performance and reliability. Furthermore, the profitability of a renewable energy project is highly dependent on the location of the power plant, as it relies on the availability of wind and solar resources, but obtaining accurate and sufficient data on these critical geographic and climate factors can be challenging. Finally, a lack of in-country expertise for the construction and operation of renewable energy power plants can also pose challenges that may ultimately impact the project\\'s profitability. Financing One of the main obstacles to investment in renewable energy is accessing affordable finance. The high upfront costs associated with renewable energy technologies require long-term financing, but the cost of capital can quickly escalate in countries perceived as riskier, which can pose a significant burden, particularly for developing economies (IEA, 2021a). In this context, the availability of international public finance is a critical determinant of FDI in renewable energy in developing countries (Ragosa and Warren, 2019; Haščič et al., 2015). Additionally, a lack of knowledge and awareness of renewable energy technologies among potential sponsors and investors is another significant barrier that needs to be addressed.

Policy tools for the promotion of renewable energy investment Based on the review and mapping of 212 laws and policies2, covering 94 developing and developed economies (49 and 51 per cent respectively), this section analyses the investment promotion instruments and incentives used around the world to foster private investment in renewable energy. Countries have adopted various types of incentives (table 1). Among these, tax incentives are the instrument most often used for promoting renewable energy investment in developing countries (77 per cent), LDCs (90 per cent) and SIDS (67 per cent). In contrast, developed countries favour more targeted and complex policy instruments, with FITs, auctions and financial incentives adopted by 91 per cent, 74 per cent and 70 per cent respectively (figure 4).

These 212 laws and policies were selected because they include at least one type of investment promotion tool as defined in Table 1. 8 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Table 1 Investment promotion instruments for the renewable energy sector Fiscal incentives Profit-based Reduction of the standard corporate income tax rate or profit tax rate, tax holiday, loss carry forward Expenditure-based Accelerated depreciation, investment and reinvestment allowances, R&D tax incentives, tax credits Indirect taxes and duties Exemption or reduction of VAT on capital material, exemption on import taxes and duties Production-based Production-based tax credits Financial incentives Grants and subsidies Direct subsidies to cover (part of) capital, production or marketing costs Loans Subsidized loans Other tools Auctions Stimulate investment through government calls for tenders to install a certain capacity of renewable energy-sourced electricity, with the best bidder typically winning a long-term power purchase power agreement that guarantees sales and prices and the auctions structured as packages that include additional incentives such as access to land or low-cost grid connections Feed-in tariffs Incentivize the deployment of renewable energy by offering long-term contracts to producers with a guaranteed above-market price tariff, in a triple guarantee – certainty of sale, price and duration – that reduces project risk and encourages investment Renewable portfolio standards or quotas, and renewable energy certificates Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or quotas: define the share of renewable energy that must be present in the electricity mix of targeted entities, typically utility suppliers, companies or consumers Renewable energy certificates: represent the environmental benefits of one MWh of renewable energy generation, which can be bought and sold separately from the electricity itself Usually introduced together Other guarantee schemes Financial guarantees, including guarantees covering geological risks or other non-financial elements Business facilitation A range of measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of and investment in renewable energy companies, which may include dedicated single windows, facilitated access to land and simplified permitting and licensing, as well as access to information related to the renewable energy potential and needs of the country Source: UNCTAD 9 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M i. Tax incentives Tax incentives are well-established and well-known tools used by countries around the world to promote investment. The literature on their pros and cons is extensive. UNCTAD recently carried out a detailed mapping of their use across the globe (WIR22). Tax incentives can be customized to achieve certain policy objectives, and although they require governments to forgo tax revenue that could be used for other purposes, they do not typically require direct public spending. However, tax incentives may not directly address the main barriers to investment in renewable energy such as access to finance, market and infrastructure risks, and high upfront capital (box 1). Nonetheless, tax incentives are a common policy tool for promoting renewable energy investment, particularly in developing economies and LDCs (figure 5). Profit-based tax incentives such as corporate income tax reductions and tax holidays are particularly popular among developing countries (57 per cent of countries) and LDCs (70 per cent). The reduction or exemption of VAT and import duties is also very common in developing countries, as they often import most of the required capital goods and inputs. This instrument is used by 64 per cent of developing countries and 70 per cent of LDCs. In contrast, developed countries tend to favour the use of expenditure-based incentives and production-based tax credits. These findings are consistent with the broader analysis on the use of tax incentives for investment in developed and developing countries carried out by UNCTAD in the World Investment Report 2022. Figure 5: Tax incentives in renewable energy policies, by type and country group (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Note: The graph covers laws adopted during the period 2000–2022, but it also includes amendments of laws that were adopted before 2000. ii. Non-fiscal incentives Non-fiscal incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy include traditional policy instruments already used in the promotion of investment in other sectors, such as financial incentives (e.g. loans at preferred rates and traditional grants and subsidies), risk reduction mechanisms (e.g. guarantee schemes) and business facilitation measures. In addition, the unique specificities of the low-carbon transition have led to the development of more targeted, more complex policy instruments designed specifically to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy technologies. These new investment promotion tools include tariff-based instruments, auctions and quota-based instruments (discussed later). 10 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Grants and subsidies are the most common investment promotion instrument among traditional investment incentives. They can partially address the issue of high upfront cost associated with renewable energy projects. They are particularly favoured by developed countries. They are mentioned in the majority of the renewable energy policies that include investment promotion provisions in LDCs (figure 6). Loans, however, are not commonly used in investment promotion policies for renewable energy. In fact, only 16 per cent of developing countries and 13 per cent of developed countries use them. Figure 6: Non-fiscal incentives in renewable energy policies, by type and country group (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Note: The graph covers laws adopted during the period 2000–2022, and amendments of laws that were adopted before 2000. Guarantee schemes include financial guarantee schemes and other “in kind” type of guarantees, such as priority access to the grid, or industrial guarantees on the availability of network or spare parts for the renewable energy sector. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, priority access to the grid, in particular, is a key element to foster investment in the deployment of such technologies. Guarantee schemes are popular among developed countries (60 per cent of them have adopted at least one such scheme), but less utilized in developing countries (32 per cent) and LDCs (40 per cent). Business facilitation of renewable energy projects encompasses measures such as simplifying registration and licensing processes, providing easier access to land, and streamlining town planning authorizations. In addition to these measures, business facilitation may also involve the creation of specific tools to support renewable energy projects such as national-level solar, wind, or geothermal resource maps. Business facilitation instruments are employed in developed (45 per cent) and developing countries (34 per cent), but their use is slightly less prevalent in LDCs, where only 30 per cent of LDCs included them in their promotion policies for renewable energy (see figure 6). FITs were the first targeted incentive developed specifically to promote investment in renewable energy (see box 3). They offer guaranteed payments and have a longer-term perspective, which significantly reduces uncertainty about the return on renewable energy investments. They have led to the establishment of hundreds of MWh from renewable sources across the world. Policymakers have reformed FITs over the years to make them more efficient and more responsive to technology changes and market prices, and to decrease their impact on public finance. While the success of these instruments varies from country to country and on policy design (see policy examples in box 4), they have been widely implemented (in at least 106 countries) as a means of promoting adoption of renewable energy. 11 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 3: Feed-in tariffs Feed-in tariffs (FITs) are a mechanism implemented by governments to incentivize the deployment of renewable energy. They rely on a promise: they ensure renewable energy producers that their electricity will be bought at a predefined price over long periods. This triple guarantee — certainty of sale, price and duration — reduces project risk and encourages project developers. To give an example, a government will commit to buy all wind power produced in its country for $0,15/kWh over a period of twenty years. To define an optimal FIT scheme, policy makers need to take different elements into account: 1) Finding the right tariff level is a crucial step. If it is too low, the financial incentives will not convince project developers to invest. If it is too high, society will have to bear an unnecessary cost. The optimal price is usually based on an estimation including investment costs, grid connection costs, operation and maintenance costs, interest rates for the invested capital and profit margins for the investors. The tariff level is often degressive, meaning that it will decline each year according to a fixed percentage. This allows to take into account the expected decreasing costs of technology and to make sure that companies do not delay their investments (Alizamir, de Véricourt and Sun, 2016). In some cases, the subsidy consists of a payment rewarding the production of renewable energy which is added to the electricity market price: this system is known as feed-in premiums. The latter offer less certainty than classic FITs, given the fluctuation of the electricity market. 2) Efficient FITs are technology-specific. This helps targeting the type of renewable energy which should be developed, but also integrating the variations in terms of costs implied by each technology. 3) Determining who bares the extra cost of feed-in tariffs can impact the policy’s outcome. The national context plays an important role here. The possibility of charging the extra cost directly to users in developing countries, for example, is rather limited. 4) The contract duration is a key factor for profitability. FIT schemes can run from five to twenty years, though the majority last over fifteen years. 5) Reducing the administrative burden, like facilitating the delivery of permits and authorizations, helps improving the results of FITs. After having dominated renewable energy policies in the 2000s, FITs were criticized for their high cost and the lack of control over the quantity of renewable electricity produced they imply. Nonetheless, some developing countries are still adopting them with success. Between 2012 and 2017, for instance, the Philippines multiplied its solar, biomass and wind energy capacity by eight thanks to feed-in tariffs (Guild, 2019) (see box 3). Source: UNCTAD FITs have been particularly popular among developed countries, featuring in over 90 per cent of them. Yet, tariff-based instruments do not address the challenge of the high upfront costs associated with renewable energy projects and, depending on their features, can be relatively expensive for countries that have limited fiscal space, which explains why developing countries use FITs less frequently. Less than 50 per cent of developing countries, only 26 per cent of LDCs and only 22 per cent of SIDS have put FITs in place (figure 7). Indeed, smaller countries have often focussed instead on promoting the development of renewable energy production units at the household or small company level. SIDS, for instance tend to favour net-metering and net-billing schemes (box 5). 12 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 7: Use of feed-in tariffs, auctions and quota-based instruments, by country group, 2005–2022 (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD Box 4: Feed-in tariffs: policy examples and key lessons In 2000, Germany introduced the Renewable Energy Act, a FIT policy offering all producers of renewable energy an above-market fixed price for a twenty-years period. The first beneficiaries of this program saw it ended in 2021. The impact on renewable energy production was important: between 2000 and 2021, the share of renewable energy in electricity consumption rose by 35 per cent (ZSW, 2022). But in the late 2000s, as the production costs of photovoltaic systems decreased, the policy started to appear particularly expensive. Germany decided to reform the Renewable Energy Act and, since 2017, only small facilities under 100 kW have kept on benefiting from the FIT, while large renewable energy producers are subject to auctions (Sutton, 2021). In 2009, South Africa established a renewable energy FIT scheme. Initially, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa developed a sector-specific project that ensured rates for 15 years, with tariffs that would decrease annually. To determine the project’s feasibility, public hearings were held with prospective investors, who indicated that the incentives were insufficient, resulting in an increase in the tariffs and a lengthening of the guaranteed period to 20 years. Despite these adjustments, the FIT scheme was never put into effect and was replaced by auctions after two years. According to critics, tariff rate uncertainty, bureaucratic delays, and conflicting messages from various government bodies resulted in an atmosphere of policy uncertainty that led to the scheme’s demise (Pegels, 2014). Despite a decreasing interest for FITs in the 2010s, several countries continued using them. The Philippines, for instance, adopted FITs in 2012 with impressive results. Five years after the start of the programme, the country’s capacity in solar, biomass and wind energy had been multiplied by eight. This success shows that policy design and implementation are as crucial as rates. Indeed, project developers give a lot of importance to factors such as administrative processing times, grid access and legal security (Lüthi and Prässler, 2011; Lüthi and Wüstenhagen, 2012). The Government of the Philippines followed a list of best practices, by adopting a long-term framework and associating feed-in tariffs with financial incentives. The extra cost implied by FITs was put on the consumers (Guild, 2019). Source: UNCTAD 13 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 5: Net-metering and net-billing in small island developing States For the last ten years, SIDS have privileged net-metering and net-billing instead of feed-in tariffs to promote renewable energy production. At least 44 per cent of them have adopted these schemes, and up to 62 per cent for SIDS located in the Caribbean region (Kersey, Blechinger and Shirley, 2021; REN21, 2021). These policies seek to incentivize citizens to adopt their own units of renewable energy production, by providing guarantees. With net-metering, households upload their electricity surplus into the grid, and when they do not produce enough electricity, they are able to take some from the grid. In other words, the grid is used as a free energy storage. At the end of the year, the power utilities check the balance. If the household has produced more than it has consumed, the balance is paid at the retail electricity tariff. If the household has consumed more than it has produced, it has to pay the difference. With net-billing, households with electric capacity production are also connected to the grid, but the electricity price change according to the demand. When the electric utilities face a high demand, they are ready to buy households’ production at a higher price than when the demand is low. This system gives households the incentive to produce a surplus when the global demand is high, and to consume when the demand is low (IRENA, 2019b). By targeting households and promoting the development of small-scale renewable energy production, net-metering and net-billing are particularly adapted to SIDS’ unique characteristics. Source: UNCTAD Another policy tool designed specifically to foster investment in the deployment of renewable energy is the renewable energy auction (see table 1). Since the 2010s, auctions have boomed in popularity because they are both cost-efficient and adaptable to different economic contexts. They are used in all continents, independently of countries’ development levels, and have helped to lower renewable energy prices. The purchase power agreement and other non-financial incentives resulting from the auctions offer a long-term guarantee on price and sales that incentivizes investors to participate. For policymakers, however, the complexity of auctions lies in their design and organization, which are crucial to their success. The design should include factors such as the auctioned volume, qualification requirements for bidders, auction format and site selection. These factors will depend on a government’s policy goals and on country characteristics. It is not uncommon for countries to require multiple auction rounds to achieve an optimal design, as policymakers must bypass several pitfalls when designing an auction, such as undersubscription, underbidding, delays and underbuilding (see policy examples in box 6). Auctions have become the main mechanism for increasing renewable energy capacity worldwide, with at least 125 countries holding auctions over the last decade. Three quarters of developed countries and two thirds of developing countries have held renewable energy auctions; the shares are lower for LDCs (52 per cent) and SIDS (33 per cent) (see figure 7). The complexity of designing and holding auctions may explain the lower prevalence in these countries. A third policy instrument specifically designed to foster investment in renewable energy is the combined use of quotas, also referred to as renewable portfolio standards or renewable purchase obligations, and renewable energy certificates, which are mechanisms to certify the origin of the renewable energy (see box 7). Companies can then sell these certificates, which should, in theory, provide a bonus in revenue to renewable energy producers. Renewable portfolio standards policies are typically complex to administer. Although they are used by one third of developed countries, their adoption has been more limited in developing countries (21 per cent), LDCs (7 per cent) and SIDS (3 per cent) (see figure 7). 14 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 6: Examples of renewable energy auctions in SIDS and LDCs Maldives has held several auctions between 2014 and 2022, managing to convince project developers over time. In 2014, an auction aiming to create 1.5 MW of solar capacity attracted only four bidders, resulting in high electricity prices. Six years later, an auction for a 5 MW project attracted 25 project developers, leading to a drop in the price by 50 per cent. In 2022, an 11 MW solar project attracted 63 investors and resulted in one of the lowest tariffs ever achieved in SIDS. Investors have been convinced by the risk mitigation package supported by the World Bank, which includes guarantees, a currency convertibility clause and payment security (Chen, Jain and Stolp, 2023). Uganda launched its first solar photovoltaic auction in 2014, for a total capacity of four 5 MW facilities. Based on qualification requirements, 7 of the 23 companies that expressed interest were allowed to submit bids. Site selection was left to project developers, with the condition that the power stations would be within 3 km of the grid. Moreover, if the project was located in a set of predefined priority zones, the application would be granted more points in the evaluation. Different penalties were defined for cases of delays and underperformance. This sealed-bid auction was supported by international development partners, which committed to paying part of the electricity price. Consequently, the four winners of the auction had two contracts: a power purchase agreement of 20 years in dollars with the State-owned utility company and a premium payment contract in euros signed with the German Development Bank. Uganda also benefited from European Union support, from the development of standardized documents to the payment of the tender agent that conducting the auction (IRENA, 2018). The winning bid was $163.7/MWh – lower than the average retail tariff in 2013, but more than double the results achieved in Ethiopia, Namibia, South Africa or Zambia (Kruger, Eberhard and Swartz, 2018). Zambia was the first African country to take part in the Scaling Solar Programme, which includes multiple guarantees and technical support. Led by the World Bank, this programme aims to develop large solar power plants through auctions. In 2015, the country signed off on two projects representing a total capacity of 88 MW generated through solar photovoltaic power (IRENA, 2019). The Scaling Solar Program has benefited other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Ethiopia, Madagascar and Senegal. In 2019, Zambia awarded 120 MW of capacity for a solar photovoltaic project. This tender achieved a low-price record for Sub-Saharan Africa. It is worth noting that the auction did not define the location of the operating site, nor did it finance the connection to the grid (Parnell, 2019). Source: UNCTAD Box 7: Quotas and renewable energy certificates (RECs): key policy aspects Some governments have adopted a system of quotas and certificates to control the quantity of renewable energy produced. Accordingly, authorities set goals in terms of renewable electricity and the involved entities develop strategies to meet them, either by producing renewable energy themselves or by delegating this task. A system of tradable certificates, commonly known as renewable energy certificates, helps companies or electricity suppliers proving that they respect quotas. Knowing that there is a demand, companies specialized in renewable energy production are incentivized to develop new capacity. For each MWh of renewable energy produced and delivered to the grid, they will receive a certificate, which can be sold. They usually have two sources of revenue: the sale of electricity itself at market price and the sale of the certificates. The difference between the two covers the extra costs implied by renewable energy production and allows profits. This system follows a market mechanism. The prices of electricity and of certificates fluctuate, meaning that actors have less certainty. If there is too much offer, the certificates will see their prices decrease, leading inefficient producers to cease their activity. If there is too little offer, the certificates will see their prices increase, inviting renewable energy producers to invest. In this picture, governments usually play the role of regulators. They try to develop the best system of certificates by playing on different factors: 1) The non-respect of the quotas usually involves penalties. It is the fear of having to pay these fines which motivates the purchase of certificates. The latter are logically less expensive than penalties. The design of penalties plays an important role on the policy’s efficiency. 15 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 2) The organisation of the certificates system is key. Policymakers need to ensure that certificates are traceable and forgery-proof. To avoid double counting, certificates can usually only be sold once. They also have a fixed validity period, commonly one year, ensuring that the system remains dynamic. The optimal policy facilitates both the production and the trading of these certificates. Since their creation, quotas have been introduced in at least 41 countries, often in combination with a renewable energy certificate system. While they have been popular in developed economies, developing ones have also adopted them. These include Bolivia, China, Ghana, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Senegal, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates, among others. RECs do not necessarily come with obligations. The European Union, for example, launched in 2001 the Guarantees of Origin certificates. Their purchase is entirely voluntary and, nonetheless, they have been widely sold. Thanks to them, private companies can prove their efforts in achieving clean energy goals. Similarly, citizens buy these certificates to show their commitment to the energy transition. RECs are still attracting policymakers’ attention. To support its efforts to reach a share of 35 per cent of clean energy in its electricity mix by 2024, Mexico adopted in 2018 a combined system of quotas and market of certificates: Certificados de Energías Limpias (CEL). CEL must be bought by large electricity consumers and electricity suppliers to prove that they respect the imposed quotas. From a 5 per cent quota of clean electricity set for 2018, the share gradually increases up to 13.9 per cent in 2022. The Energy Regulatory Commission verifies the compliance of obliged entities and may impose fines. In this programme, the accepted energy is not limited to wind, solar, hydro, wave, geothermal and biomass power, but also include nuclear and efficient cogeneration. According to official data from Sener, 29 per cent of the electricity generated in 2022 in Mexico was from a clean source. Source: UNCTAD 16 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 2. Clean energy – new technologies and complex policies Besides the need for significant investments in renewable energy, a rapid transition to low-carbon energy also requires parallel investments for greening existing and future fossil fuel power plants. Indeed, despite the expansion of renewable energy, thermal generation remains the primary source of both electricity and heat worldwide (IEA, 2021b) and new thermal capacity is still being built around the world every year. Thermal power plants will still have useful technical lives, even in a time when countries should have already reduced their use of fossil fuels to comply with climate targets. In emerging economies, 83 per cent of these power plants are expected to remain technically useful in 2030, and 61 per cent in 2040, in light of recent investments (IEA, 2021b). In this context, while ultimately the objective is to phase out fossil fuels, it is important to include thermal power plants into the low-carbon transition and consider a mix of technologies to reach global energy and climate goals. To decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel plants, three main levers can be considered: increasing their efficiency, developing CCUS technologies, and using cofiring and low-carbon fuels (figure 8). Figure 8: Key aspects of the clean energy transition of the power sector Source: UNCTAD a. Increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants Several technologies can increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants by reducing the amount of fuel required to generate a given amount of electricity, which can lower costs and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. One of them is combined heat and power (CHP) technologies. CHP technologies, also known as cogeneration, produce both electricity and heat. They capture the heat that is usually released into the environment in traditional power plants and use it for other purposes. CHP technologies are very efficient. For example, in the United States, the average efficiency of fossil-fueled power plants is 36 per cent. In comparison, CHP technologies can achieve energy efficiency levels of up to 90 per cent.3 3 These number comes from the US Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/chp/chp-benefits#:~:text=By%20recovering%20and%20 using%20heat,achieve%20efficiencies%20approaching%2090%20percent, accessed on 16 March 2023). EPA uses the “total system efficiency” to calculate CHP efficiency: the total electricity and useful thermal energy output of the system divided by the fuel used to produce the electricity and useful thermal energy. 17 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Despite the theoretical benefits and the maturity of CHP technologies, investment in their deployment is still limited. The first European Union Directive on the promotion of cogeneration has been adopted in 2004. However, the share of CHP in total electricity generation has been relatively stable since 2005 (11 per cent in 2005 and 12 per cent in 2019). 4 Indeed, although CHP technologies were encouraged in several European countries, promotion mechanisms often proved little effective, as the prices of certificates of origin were kept at relatively low levels (Stoltmann et al, 2019). Other barriers remain, such as the lack of district heating networks,5 access to the grid, especially for smaller projects, low demand for heat, and high upfront costs. The adoption of CHP technologies has been considerably slower in developing countries, except for larger countries like China and India (box 8). Box 8: Examples of policies to promote CHP technologies China\\'s 14th Five-Year Plan prioritized energy security and decarbonization in its energy strategy. Since the 2000s, cogeneration has been a significant aspect of China\\'s energy policy, and the country has a well-established district heating system. However, China\\'s district heating system still primarily relies on coal-based cogeneration power plants, which have caused significant environmental problems, particularly in terms of air quality. Consequently, China has focused its efforts on promoting efficient gas-based cogeneration power plants and developing nuclear-based cogeneration units. The country\\'s nuclear development policy emphasizes the development of small and micro nuclear units, which facilitate cogeneration and the use of nuclear energy for heating. In 2022, Haiyang became the first Chinese city to benefit from a nuclear-based district heating system (1). In 2004, the European Union issued a directive to promote cogeneration (2). This directive mandates member States to publish a cogeneration report every four years. In 2012, the European Union\\'s Energy Efficiency Directive was introduced, which requires member States to encourage the use of highly efficient cogeneration technologies and to conduct energy efficiency assessments of CHP systems. The directive also stipulates that European Union member States ensure the traceability of electricity generated from high-efficiency cogeneration through guarantees of origin (3). In 2017, Greece introduced feed-in premiums to combined heat and power plants through tenders. In 2020, Poland introduced financial incentives for high-efficiency power cogeneration, in the form of premiums paid to producers of electricity from cogeneration units. In the United States, the promotion of CHP technologies has been facilitated through a variety of policies and regulations at both the Federal and State levels. These policies include loans, grants, feed-in tariffs, production incentives, and tax incentives. Some States have also implemented CHP Portfolio Standards in the past decade, which require utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from CHP systems. More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, provides a 30 per cent investment tax credit for CHP projects that begin construction before January 1, 2025.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage CCUS technologies involve capturing CO2 from large point sources, such as industrial or power generation facilities that use fossil fuels or biomass, or directly from the atmosphere. Once captured, the CO2 is compressed and transported by pipeline, rail, ship, or truck for various applications or injected into deep geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline formations, for permanent storage. CCUS technologies can be retrofitted in existing fossil fuel power plants and can become critical to achieve global climate goals, while also ensuring universal energy access. CCUS technologies deployment is fairly recent, and to achieve net zero by 2050, investment in CCUS technologies needs to be scaled up. In 2022, according to the IEA, there were only around 35 commercial facilities applying CCUS to industrial processes, fuel transformation and power generation. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in momentum, with approximately 300 CCUS projects at various stages of development throughout the CCUS value chain. More than 200 new capture facilities are expected to become operational by 2030, capturing over 220 million tons of CO2 annually. Despite this fast progress, at current levels, CCUS deployment would still fall well short of what is required to achieve the net zero scenario (IEA, 2022a). In addition, it should be noted that CCUS is not yet mature technology and negative environmental impact can also arise from the use of CCUS in combination with traditional fuels. When CCUS technologies are added to a thermal power plant, more energy is needed to generate the same amount of electricity, which can lead to increased environmental damage throughout the value chain, such as methane leaks and other forms of environmental degradation (UNEP, 2016). Promoting the development and deployment of CCUS technologies requires a regulatory framework that addresses the entire value chain. This framework should include legal and regulatory measures to ensure safe and secure CO2 storage, protection of public health and the environment, and effective management of CCUS activities through the whole value chain (e.g. capture, transport, use and long-term storage). Laws and regulations must be put in place to clarify the rights and responsibilities of CCUS stakeholders, particularly in long-term storage resource management (IEA 2022b). Such policies will provide certainty to investors, build public confidence, and increase acceptance of this technology. While several countries have already developed comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks for CCUS, these efforts have largely been limited to developed economies (e.g. Australia, Canada, Norway, the United States, and the European Union), with some notable exceptions in developing countries (e.g. China, Singapore). So far, governments have adopted a mix of regulations (e.g. CO2 emission limitation, carbon pricing) and promotion instruments (e.g. R&D and investment incentives) to foster the deployment of CCUS (box 9). 19 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 9: Examples of policies to promote CCUS technologies In 2017, China established technology targets focused on achieving cost-effective large-scale CCUS, with its Special Program Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation to Address Climate Change, part of the 13th Five-Year Plan. It aimed to bolster the global competitiveness of China’s low-carbon industry and reach its emissions peak by 2030. In 2021, Australia launched a program worth AUD 250 million to deploy CCUS technologies at scale. The CCUS Hubs and Technologies program aims to enhance Australia’s CCUS capabilities by promoting collaborations between domestic and international researchers and reducing the cost of technology adoption. In 2021, Singapore created the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative, which aims to develop low-carbon energy technologies in hydrogen and CCUS, to support the decarbonization of the power and industry sectors. In 2021, Sweden announced subsidies to players investing in bio-CCS facilities, the process of capturing, separating and storing CO2 from renewable sources. The first reversed auction is planned for 2023. In 2022, Canada implemented an investment tax credit for CCUS, including direct air capture projects and equipment for transportation, storage and use. In 2022, the United Kingdom published the “Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (CCUS): Investor Roadmap”, which outlines key opportunities for investment in CCUS in the country. Additionally, the United Kingdom has implemented an R&D policy to foster innovation in the sector. The CCUS Innovation 2.0 program is a funding initiative worth £20 million aimed at reducing the expense of capturing and storing CO2 in the country. The programme intends to showcase and mitigate the risks of next-generation CCUS technologies, allowing for their commercial deployment from 2025. It also aims to decrease the cost of deploying CCUS and create competitive pressures on existing technologies. In 2022, the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act modified and extended to January 2033 the existing federal tax credit (named 45Q) that rewards companies for each ton of carbon dioxide that has been securely stored geologically in approved reservoirs and aquifers.

Cofiring low-carbon fuels Co-firing techniques, which involve mixing a low-carbon fuel (such as sustainable biomass and waste, low-carbon hydrogen, or low carbon ammonia) with the fossil fuel in a power plant, have made significant progress in recent years. 6 The transition of fossil fuel power plants to low-carbon fuels combustion and cofiring can therefore be an important tool for decarbonizing the power sector while utilizing existing assets and their related infrastructure. To achieve decarbonization at larger scale, however, the price and the GHG emission of these low-carbon fuels must decrease further and for that, investment in low carbon fuels need to increase further. Indeed, while hydrogen is always low carbon in its usage, it is not always low carbon in its production (box 10). In order to promote investment in green hydrogen, a country needs to promote the development of both the necessary infrastructure for producing, storing and transporting hydrogen, as well as the production facilities themselves. The adoption of a dedicated strategy can be a tool to address these inter-related aspects. Since Japan introduced the first national hydrogen strategy in 2017, 45 countries around the world have implemented a national hydrogen strategy or roadmap, as of February 2023 (figure 9), including 18 member States of the European Union, 9 Latin American and Caribbean countries, 4 African countries, and 9 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 6 Co-firing of up to 20 per cent of ammonia and over 90 per cent of hydrogen has been achieved at small power plants. Low-carbon ammonia (NH3) is produced by using hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis and nitrogen separated from the air. These are then fed into the Haber process (also known as Haber-Bosch). The ammonia is green when it is produced with low-carbon hydrogen and the Haber process powered by sustainable energy. 20 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 10: The “colours” of hydrogen Green hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources through a process called electrolysis, which involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electric current. Since the electricity used to trigger the chemical reaction comes from renewable sources, green hydrogen is considered a clean fuel with no emissions during the production process. Black or brown hydrogen is produced using black coal or lignite (brown coal). The gasification of coal, the method used to produce black hydrogen, is a very polluting process, as both CO2 and carbon monoxide are produced as by-products and released into the atmosphere. It is the most environmentally harmful type of hydrogen. Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, usually natural gas, through a process called steam methane reforming. The term “grey” refers to the fact that this process produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere. Blue hydrogen is produced using the same process as grey hydrogen, but with the addition of CCUS technology to capture the carbon dioxide emissions and store them underground. While blue hydrogen is sometimes considered as an important transitional fuel that can help reduce emissions, greenhouse gas emissions from the production of blue hydrogen are far from insignificant, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane, a powerful GHG. Purple hydrogen is produced from nuclear energy sources through a process called high-temperature electrolysis. Pink hydrogen is produced through the same electrolysis processes as green hydrogen, but the electricity used in the process comes from nuclear power plants. White hydrogen is the naturally occurring hydrogen in underground deposits. Identified deposits are still very limited and there is no strategy to exploit them at present.

Fossil fuel subsidies: a disincentive to clean energy investment Countries adopt fossil fuel subsidies for a variety of reasons, including job creation, economic growth, energy security, consumer benefits, and political and strategic interests. By artificially lowering the cost of producing and consuming fossil fuels, subsidies make such fuels more appealing to consumers and investors. This, in turn, makes it more challenging for renewable energy sources to compete to attract investment, particularly when they do not receive the same level of support. Fossil fuel subsidies also create an incumbent advantage, reinforcing the position of fossil fuels in the electricity system (IISD, 2014). While recognizing the economic, social and political complexity of such reform, phasing out these subsidies can help increase investment in renewable energy. In recent years, fossil fuel subsidies represented on average about half a per cent of world GDP, and up to 1 per cent of GDP in developing countries (for some countries, up to 7 per cent of GDP)7. Phasing them out and redirecting those funds to support renewable energy can therefore make clean energy a more viable option. Finally, reducing these subsidies can also send a clear signal to the market that governments are committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy and to attracting investment in the renewable energy sector. Despite reiterated commitments on major international forums to discontinue these inefficient subsidies (box 11), the global level of support in 2021 remained similar to that of 2010, totalling over $500 billion.8 In 2022, according to IEA estimates, global fossil fuel subsidies doubled from the previous year to an all-time high of $1 trillion (IEA, 2023). This is almost eight times the amount of global subsidies granted to renewable power generation technologies in 2017, as estimated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (Taylor, 2020). Box 11: Key international commitments on fossil fuel subsidies reduction United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): In 2015, the United Nations included fossil fuel subsidy reform as part of its sustainable development agenda. SDG 12.c calls for countries to \\\\\"rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption\\\\\". Paris Agreement: The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, includes a commitment to \\\\\"making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\\\\\" This commitment includes the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies. The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh reiterated a commitment made at the COP26 held in Glasgow in 2021, where a number of countries and organizations agreed to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. The Glasgow Leaders\\' Declaration on Clean Energy Transitions, signed by over 100 countries, includes a commitment to \\\\\"accelerate action to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and increase emissions.\\\\\" The declaration also calls for increased funding for the clean energy transition in developing countries. In addition, the G7 and G20 have made several statements regarding the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies. Among them, in 2015, G7 leaders committed to \\\\\"phase out and rationalize over the medium-term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption”. In 2009, G20 leaders reiterated that commitment, “recognizing the need to support the poor”, and in 2019, G20 leaders acknowledged \\\\\"the need for transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and the importance of phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\\\\\" Source: UNCTAD. 7 UNCTAD computations based on data from FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org 8 According to the IMF, this figure rises to almost $6 trillion (or 6.8 per cent of world GDP), if the hidden costs of fossil fuels, including their impact on air pollution and global warming are taken into account (IMF, 2021). 22 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Data on fossil fuel subsidies at the global level show that they are closely tied to the evolution of oil prices, rather than to deliberate policy decisions aimed at their reduction. The correlation is particularly strong for oil, electricity and gas subsidies, but less so for coal subsidies, which have remained stable throughout the period, hovering around $20 billion per year (see figure 10). Figure 10: Global fossil fuel subsidies by type and the price of oil, 2010–2022 (Billions of dollars and dollars per barrel) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Note: *Estimate from IEA (2023) Global trends mask the differences in the evolution of subsidies offered by developed and developing regions, and by type of fuel (figure 11). On average, developing countries account for over three quarters of world subsidies on oil, gas and electricity for end-user consumption of fossil fuel origin. However, while subsidies on oil have decreased significantly in developing countries, they have increased steadily in developed countries, almost doubling in volume between 2010 and 2021. Conversely, coal subsidies have declined steadily over the past decade in developed regions, dropping from $18.5 billion in 2010 to $9.8 billion in 2021, but more than doubled in developing regions, increasing from $5.6 billion in 2010 to $13.3 billion in 2021. The data for 2022 is not yet complete, but there is a likelihood that subsidies on gas in developed countries saw a substantial increase to offset the rise in prices during that year. 23 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 11: Fossil fuel subsidies in developed and developing economies, by type and region 2010-2021 (Billions of dollars) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Data collected by the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker initiative indicates that such subsidies also increasingly benefit producers rather than consumers. Although consumers remain the key beneficiaries of fossil fuels subsidies, their share in total subsidies has declined by 10 per cent between 2010 and 2020, while the share of producer subsidies has doubled in the same period (from 7 to 14 per cent). The record share of producer subsidies in 2020 may be due to the sudden and unexpected fall in demand for energy brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred policymakers to consider financial assistance to fossil fuel companies in order to mitigate damage to the industry (Kotchen, 2021). The trend, however, started well before the pandemic, with alarming consequences on investment attractiveness. Again, global trends obscure significant differences between countries at different levels of development. Notably, in developing countries, consumer subsidies have decreased from 97 to 87 per cent of the total between 2010 and 2020, while producer subsidies have increased from 3 to 10 per cent in the same period. Conversely, in developed countries, consumer subsidies have slightly increased their share of total fossil fuel subsidies from 2010 to 2020 (from 64 to 68 per cent), while producer subsidies have remained stable at around 25 per cent (figure 12). 24 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 12: Fossil fuel subsidies by beneficiary in developed and developing countries, 2010 and 2020 (Per cent) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Although there is universal agreement on the need to reduce or remove fossil fuel subsidies, it remains a complex policy issue, particularly in developing countries, which must overcome multiple competing interests and challenges: • Dependence on fossil fuels: Many developing countries rely heavily on fossil fuels, both as a source of energy and as a revenue stream. Reducing or removing subsidies could result in a gap in energy supply as well as higher energy costs and a loss of export revenue, which may be difficult for governments to manage. • Energy for all: Although studies show that fossil fuel subsidies are regressive by nature and benefit the wealthiest the most, subsidies can help make energy more affordable for low-income households. 9 Removing them could lead to an increase in energy poverty, which is a major concern for many developing countries. • Short-term economic impacts: The International Labour Organization estimates that the transition to net zero brings substantial new opportunities for employment, but the new jobs may be in different locations or require different skill sets, thus calling for policies to minimize hardship and promote skills upgrading. Reducing or removing subsidies may also result in short-term economic impacts, such as job losses in the fossil fuel industry and higher energy costs for consumers and businesses. These impacts may be difficult for governments to manage and may lead to resistance to change. • Political interests: The removal of subsidies may face opposition from large corporations, which may have significant political influence, as well as a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Nonetheless, according to the IEA, achieving net zero by 2050 will require the elimination of all fossil fuel subsidies in the coming years (IEA, 2021c). Hence, governments must navigate these challenges carefully and develop a well-thought-out plan for phasing out subsidies in a manner that minimizes negative impacts, is inclusive and supports the transition to a low-carbon economy in a just and cost-effective manner (WIR23). 9 See, for instance, Moayed, Guggenheim and von Chamier (2021), or World Bank (2012). 25 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 4. Conclusion UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2023 calls for urgent support to developing countries to enable them to attract significantly more investment for their transition to clean energy. UNCTAD\\'s 8th WIF, which came to a close on 20 October, also called on public and private investors to play a pivotal role in reshaping the world economy and advancing the energy transition. Recognizing that policies and regulations have a key role to play in de-risking as well as incentivizing investment in the clean energy sector, the Forum generated insights and policy proposals for further discussions at COP28. Investing in renewables and clean energy is hindered by a range of specific risks and challenges, leading to higher costs of capital, especially in emerging and developing countries. Factors such as the natural resources endowment, the quality of the regulatory environment, market size and maturity, and economic and political uncertainty determine the unique potential and risk profile of each country. While policymakers in all countries should ensure that the key policy determinants for the promotion of renewable and clean energy investment are addressed through a solid legal and regulatory framework, 10 the analysis in this Investment Policy Monitor has highlighted a number of additional policy lessons: 1. Developing countries and LDCs face specific challenges in the development and adoption of policies and strategies specific to renewable energy. When such policies exist, they typically lack a focus on the promotion of private investment. Similarly, in the case of clean energy technologies, efforts to develop comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks have largely been limited to developed and large emerging economies. 2. The policy tools employed to promote renewable energy (summarized in table 2) are often not suited to country- and industry-specific situations. Developing countries and LDCs tend to rely more on generic promotion instruments, such as profit-based tax incentives, because of familiarity with those tools, their lower level of complexity and the fact that they do not require upfront expenditure of public funds. However, these instruments can be expensive in the long run (in terms of forgone government revenues), and their effectiveness in the promotion of renewable energy investment is often low because they do not directly tackle the key challenges for investors in the sector. Advanced economies tend to use more complex and targeted mechanisms to promote investment in the renewables and energy infrastructure sectors (e.g. feed-in tariffs and auctions). The choice of the investment promotion instruments employed needs to take into account country, location as well as technology-specific criteria, including factors such as market size, regulatory capacities, and infrastructure gaps, which are critical for selecting the appropriate promotion tools for derisking investments and fostering their deployment. 3. Despite reiterated commitments to discontinue inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the global level of support has reached record levels, and increasingly benefits fossil fuel producers. These subsidies are detrimental to climate change mitigation in and by themselves, and they are also a factor holding back renewables investment in some countries. They affect the incentive for firms to invest in clean energy, and they weigh heavily on government resources to support energy transition investment. Reallocating resources currently devoted to supporting traditional fossil fuel technologies can facilitate the adoption of targeted policies and regulations for promoting clean energy. To address the above challenges and promote a balanced approach that considers all three objectives of the energy transition – meeting climate goals, providing affordable energy for all and ensuring energy security – the World Investment Report 2023 puts forward a Global Action Compact for Investment in Sustainable Energy for All. The compact recognizes the need to find an equilibrium in investment and energy policymaking between many 10 See, in this regard: “Promoting Sustainable Investment in Renewable Energy for Global Economic Recovery”, an Issues Paper jointly prepared by the Indonesian Presidency of the G20 and UNCTAD to facilitate the discussions at the 2nd G20 Trade, Investment and Industry Working Group Meeting, 6-7 July 2022, Solo, Indonesia. 26 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M alternative approaches and proposes six action packages covering national and international investment policymaking; global, regional and South–South partnerships and cooperation; financing mechanisms and tools, and sustainable finance markets.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Laurent Fabius, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France and President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21); and François Hollande, President of France celebrate after the historic adoption of Paris Agreement on climate change. \\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement\\\\n===================\\\\n\\\\nClimate change is a global emergency that goes beyond national borders. It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels.\\\\n\\\\nTo tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the [UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris](http://www.cop21paris.org/) reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf).\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:\\\\n\\\\n*   substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\\\\n*   periodically assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of this agreement and its long-term goals\\\\n*   provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts.\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, [195 Parties](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&clang=_en) (194 States plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries’ climate goals.\\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement provides a durable framework guiding the global effort for decades to come. It marks the beginning of a shift towards a [net-zero](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition) emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/17-goals-to-transform-our-world).\\\\n\\\\nHow does it work?\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as [**Nationally Determined Contribution**](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs), or NDC.\\\\n\\\\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures.\\\\n\\\\n In 2023, the first **“[global stocktake](https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake)”** of the world’s efforts under the Paris Agreement concluded at **[COP28](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop28)** with a [decision](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_L17_adv.pdf) on how to accelerate action across all areas – mitigation, adaptation, and finance – by 2030, including a call on governments to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to [renewable energy](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy) such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments.\\\\n\\\\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit **long-term strategies**. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\\\\n\\\\nThe operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the [Paris Rulebook](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/katowice-climate-package), and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.\\\\n\\\\n_More information on the Paris Agreement can be found [here](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)._\\\\n\\\\n![Image 3: Key elements of the Paris Agreement](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020/12/key-elements_parisagreement.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### Key elements of the\\\\n\\\\n Paris Agreement\\\\n\\\\n*   To keep global temperatures well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times while pursuing means to limit the increase to 1.5C.\\\\n*   To review countries’ contribution to cutting emissions every five years\\\\n*   To help poorer nations by providing climate finance to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy\\\\n\\\\n### Aidan Gallagher: The Paris Agreement Works\\\\n\\\\n### What is the \\'Paris Agreement\\', and how does it work?\\\\n\\\\nRead more\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 4](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/image011.png)](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition)\\\\n### [Net zero](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition)\\\\n\\\\nWhat is net zero?

The [feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/feed-in-tariff.asp) – which has been adopted by many other countries – pays renewable energy producers a set rate per kilowatt-hour for electricity they feed into the grid.\\\\n\\\\nGermany also provides homeowners with [tax incentives for energy-efficient renovations](https://www.iea.org/policies/11633-tax-deductions-for-building-renovations) – households can claim back 20% of renovation costs up to €40,000 ($44,000) if they replace inefficient doors or windows, or buy new heating systems and insulation.\\\\n\\\\nUS\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) arrived later than many other renewable energy initiatives, but it is so large in scope that it transformed the nation to a global leader in decarbonization investment potential almost overnight.\\\\n\\\\nNearly [$400 billion in federal funding](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) is available across a wide range of sectors, mainly in the form of tax credits. A lot of the incentives are there to help the private sector invest in large-scale projects, like producing clean hydrogen or nuclear facilities. But some are there to help households decarbonize and benefit from the typically lower unit costs of renewables.\\\\n\\\\n0 seconds of 0 seconds Volume 90%\\\\n\\\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\\\n\\\\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\\\\n\\\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\\\n\\\\nPlay/Pause SPACE\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Volume↑\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Volume↓\\\\n\\\\nSeek Forward→\\\\n\\\\nSeek Backward←\\\\n\\\\nCaptions On/Off c\\\\n\\\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\\\\n\\\\nMute/Unmute m\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Caption Size-\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\\\\n\\\\nSeek %0-9\\\\n\\\\n0.5x 1x 1.25x 1.5x 2x\\\\n\\\\nLive\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\nUS citizens can get $2,000 per year in credits for installing a heat pump, and up to $7,500 in credits for a new electric vehicle.\\\\n\\\\nIndia\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIndia is aiming for [65% of its power generation to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/india-to-have-over-65-power-generation-capacity-from-non-fossil-fuels-by-2030-rk-singh/articleshow/94910750.cms).\\\\n\\\\nThe right incentives can catapult renewable energy growth – a [solar power initiative in Gujarat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/india-solar-power-gujarat/) has been so successful that the state accounts for around two-thirds of all residential rooftop solar power in the country, despite covering just 6% of India’s land mass.\\\\n\\\\n0 seconds of 0 seconds Volume 90%\\\\n\\\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\\\n\\\\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\\\\n\\\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\\\n\\\\nPlay/Pause SPACE\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Volume↑\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Volume↓\\\\n\\\\nSeek Forward→\\\\n\\\\nSeek Backward←\\\\n\\\\nCaptions On/Off c\\\\n\\\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\\\\n\\\\nMute/Unmute m\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Caption Size-\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\\\\n\\\\nSeek %0-9\\\\n\\\\n0.5x 1x 1.25x 1.5x 2x\\\\n\\\\nAuto 960p 640p 480p 320p\\\\n\\\\nLive\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\nAustralia\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\n[Australia wants more than 80% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030](https://www.iea.org/news/australia-has-raised-its-climate-targets-and-now-needs-to-accelerate-its-clean-energy-transition-says-new-iea-review), and it is providing help for households to offset the high upfront costs of some energy systems.\\\\n\\\\nHouseholds installing small-scale energy systems – be that solar, wind or hydro – or a hot water system can benefit from financial incentives under the [Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/How-the-scheme-works/Small-scale-Renewable-Energy-Scheme).\\\\n\\\\nDiscover\\\\nHow is the World Economic Forum facilitating the transition to clean energy?\\\\n\\\\nShow more\\\\n\\\\nThe [Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024 report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/fostering-effective-energy-transition-2023#report-nav) showed that after a decade of progress, the global energy transition has plateaued amid the global energy crisis and geopolitical volatilities.\\\\n\\\\nThe World Economic Forum’s [Centre for Energy and Materials](https://centres.weforum.org/centre-for-energy-and-materials/home) is driving the transition to a “fit for 2050” energy system.

Incentives and Disincentives\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n21 Nov 2023\\\\n\\\\nUNCTAD has just released a new edition of its [Investment Policy Monitor](https://unctad.org/publication/investment-policies-energy-transition-incentives-and-disincentives) on investment policies for the energy transition. This Monitor reviews and analyses policies related to some of the main incentives and disincentives to clean energy investment, expanding on the findings and analysis presented in the World Investment Report 2023: Investing in sustainable energy for all (WIR23) and further drawing from the insights and the discussion at UNCTAD\\'s 8th World Investment Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October 2023.\\\\n\\\\nUNCTAD\\'s World Investment Report 2023 highlights a worrisome increase in the SDG investment gap, surpassing $4 trillion annually in developing countries alone, with energy investment needs estimated at $2.2 trillion per year. Successful energy transition necessitates significant investment in renewable energy projects, the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, investing in renewables and clean energy is hindered by a range of specific risks and challenges, leading to higher costs of capital, especially in emerging and developing countries. Factors such as the natural resources endowment, the quality of the regulatory environment, market size and maturity, and economic and political uncertainty determine the unique potential and risk profile of each country.\\\\n\\\\nPolicies and regulations play a pivotal role in both de-risking and incentivizing investment in the clean energy sector. The Monitor thus reviews and analyses 800 renewable energy policies around the world, identifying the key policy tools employed by countries in different regions and at varying levels of development to promote renewable investments.\\\\n\\\\nThe Monitor’s findings reveal that existing policy frameworks aimed at promoting investment in the energy transition are notably inadequate, especially in poorer nations. Around the world, two-thirds of countries have adopted renewable energy policies. However, only half of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and one-third of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have done so. While developed and emerging economies have integrated private investment promotion mechanisms into over 70 per cent of their renewable energy policies, the same holds true for only 24 per cent of policies in LDCs and 17 percent of those in SIDS.\\\\n\\\\nWhile most developed economies use targeted investment promotion policies, many developing countries use generic tax incentives – applicable to investment in any industry – that do not address the specificities of energy investment projects. In recent times, auctions and tenders for renewable energy projects have gained traction across all country groups.\\\\n\\\\nThe monitor also provides an overview of existing clean energy transition policies in technologies and fuels that would allow the decarbonization of the traditional power sector. While ultimately the policy objective is to phase out fossil fuels, thermal power plants will continue to play a role in ensuring energy security for many countries in the years to come. To curb their environmental impact, broader adoption of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, cofiring, and low-carbon fuels is key. At present, policies and initiatives to promote investment in such technologies are predominantly confined to developed countries and large emerging economies.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, this edition of the Investment Policy Monitor also highlights trends in the evolution of fossil fuel subsidies around the world, which represent a disincentive to the promotion of investment in clean energy. The value of fossil fuel subsidies has reached a staggering $1 trillion, far surpassing support for renewable energy. Gradually phasing out these subsidies, although complex for many countries, would incentivize investments in renewables.\\\\n\\\\nDownload it [here](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcbinf2023d8_en.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 28: Arrow](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/arrow.png)![Image 29: Arrow](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/arrow.png)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 30: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/logo-white.png)\\\\n\\\\n[UNCTAD Home](https://unctad.org/)|[UNCTAD Investment](https://unctad.org/en/pages/DIAE/DIAE.aspx)|[World Investment Reports](https://worldinvestmentreport.unctad.org/)|[World Investment Forum](https://worldinvestmentforum.unctad.org/#/ms-1/1)\\\\n\\\\n CONTACT \\\\n\\\\n[](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/contact)\\\\n\\\\n FOLLOW US \\\\n\\\\n[](https://twitter.com/unctadwif)[](https://www.youtube.com/user/UNCTADInvestment)\\\\n\\\\n UNCTAD - Palais des Nations, 8-14, Av. de la Paix, 1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland \\\\n\\\\n ©[Copyright](https://unctad.org/copyright) | [Privacy notice](https://unctad.org/privacy) | [Terms of use](https://unctad.org/terms)\\\\n\\\\nSign up for our Newsletter\\\\n\\\\n![Image 31](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\\\\n\\\\nOriginal text\\\\n\\\\nRate this translation\\\\n\\\\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\\\\n\"}, {\"title\": \"Decoding Renewable Energy Subsidies Across Continents\", \"url\": \"https://energypedia.co/decoding-renewable-energy-subsidies-across-continents/\", \"content\": \"Governments provide these subsidies to address market barriers, such as high upfront costs of renewable technologies and competition from cheaper fossil fuels.

Yet, behind this remarkable growth lies a critical enabler: government subsidies. From tax credits that make solar panels affordable for homeowners to grants that fund groundbreaking wind energy projects, subsidies act as a financial backbone, propelling nations toward ambitious climate goals.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, not all subsidy programs are created equal. Across continents, the approaches to incentivizing renewable energy vary widely, reflecting differences in economic priorities, resource availability, and political will. Some regions have mastered the art of balancing market dynamics with fiscal support, while others grapple with inefficiencies and challenges that stifle progress.\\\\n\\\\nThis article delves into the diverse landscape of renewable energy subsidies worldwide, unraveling how these financial tools are shaping the global energy transition. By examining successes, challenges, and regional nuances, we aim to shed light on what works, what doesn’t, and what the future might hold for a subsidy-driven renewable energy revolution.\\\\n\\\\n### **What Are Renewable Energy Subsidies?**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies are financial mechanisms designed to encourage the adoption and development of sustainable energy sources. These subsidies come in various forms, including tax credits, which reduce the tax liabilities of individuals or businesses investing in renewable energy systems; grants, which provide upfront funding for renewable projects; and feed-in tariffs, which guarantee fixed prices for energy producers who supply electricity from renewable sources to the grid. Other forms include loan guarantees, rebates, and performance-based incentives, each tailored to specific energy needs and market conditions.\\\\n\\\\nGovernments provide these subsidies to address market barriers, such as high upfront costs of renewable technologies and competition from cheaper fossil fuels. By making green energy more economically viable, subsidies encourage innovation, attract private investment, and drive economies of scale. They also play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning national energy policies with international climate agreements like the Paris Accord.\\\\n\\\\nThe importance of renewable energy subsidies cannot be overstated in the fight against climate change. By accelerating the transition to cleaner energy, these subsidies not only mitigate environmental risks but also promote energy security and create economic opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.\\\\n\\\\n### **Subsidy Frameworks in Different Continents**\\\\n\\\\n**North America**\\\\n\\\\nIn North America, subsidies play a pivotal role in renewable energy development. The United States has made significant strides with policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which allocates billions in tax credits for renewable energy projects and clean energy manufacturing. State-level initiatives further bolster these efforts, such as California’s solar rebate programs and Texas’s wind energy incentives. Similarly, Canada supports green energy through federal grants, tax credits, and research funding, emphasizing a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.\\\\n\\\\n**Europe**\\\\n\\\\nEurope’s commitment to renewable energy is anchored in the European Green Deal, a comprehensive policy package aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU employs a mix of subsidy mechanisms, including carbon pricing, which penalizes high emitters, and renewable energy auctions, where companies compete for contracts based on cost-effectiveness. These tools have propelled countries like Denmark and Spain into renewable energy leadership positions.\\\\n\\\\n**Asia**\\\\n\\\\nIn Asia, subsidies reflect the continent’s diverse economic and environmental priorities. China, the world’s largest renewable energy investor, provides extensive subsidies for solar and wind projects, coupled with low-interest loans and tax incentives. India has adopted innovative schemes like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) for solar manufacturing, while Japan focuses on funding offshore wind projects. However, balancing subsidies with rapid economic growth remains a challenge for many Asian countries.\\\\n\\\\n**Africa**\\\\n\\\\nAfrica faces unique challenges in implementing renewable energy subsidies due to limited financial resources and infrastructural gaps. However, there are success stories, such as South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), which has attracted significant private investment. This program demonstrates how targeted subsidies can catalyze green energy development, even in resource-constrained regions.\\\\n\\\\n**South America**\\\\n\\\\nSouth America, particularly Brazil, has emerged as a renewable energy leader, thanks to its abundant natural resources and robust subsidy frameworks. Brazil’s government provides incentives for wind and bioenergy projects, leveraging regional cooperation and international funding. This has positioned the country as a global model for renewable energy integration.\\\\n\\\\n### **Case Studies of Success and Challenges**\\\\n\\\\n**Success: Germany’s Feed-in Tariff Program**\\\\n\\\\nGermany’s feed-in tariff (FiT) program is a textbook example of how subsidies can successfully drive renewable energy adoption. Introduced in the early 2000s, the program guaranteed fixed payments to renewable energy producers for feeding electricity into the grid. This stable pricing model encouraged widespread investment in solar and wind energy, transforming Germany into a renewable energy powerhouse. By 2020, renewable sources accounted for over 40% of the country’s energy mix, showcasing the long-term impact of consistent and well-designed subsidies.\\\\n\\\\n**Challenges: Inefficiencies and Corruption**\\\\n\\\\nHowever, not all subsidy programs achieve their intended outcomes. In some regions, inefficiencies and corruption have undermined the effectiveness of renewable energy subsidies. For instance, poorly targeted subsidies can result in funds being allocated to projects with limited impact, while a lack of transparency can lead to misuse of resources. These issues highlight the importance of robust governance and monitoring mechanisms to ensure subsidies fulfill their intended purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### **Balancing Effectiveness with Sustainability**\\\\n\\\\nStriking the right balance between subsidy effectiveness and fiscal sustainability remains a challenge. Over-reliance on subsidies can create dependency, deterring market competitiveness once the financial support is withdrawn. Policymakers must design frameworks that gradually reduce subsidies as technologies mature, encouraging private sector innovation and investment to take over.\\\\n\\\\n### **Impact of Subsidies on Global Energy Transition**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies have significantly accelerated innovation and adoption. By reducing the cost of technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage, subsidies have made renewable energy more accessible to households and businesses alike. This has driven economies of scale, lowering costs further and making renewables increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.\\\\n\\\\nThe economic and social benefits of subsidies are also profound. They create jobs in emerging industries, improve energy access in underserved regions, and reduce energy costs for consumers. For instance, subsidies have enabled rural electrification projects in developing countries, empowering communities with clean, affordable energy.\\\\n\\\\nDespite their success, subsidies come with challenges. Dependency on financial support can distort markets, while abrupt policy changes can disrupt industry growth. Countries must navigate these complexities carefully, ensuring subsidies are both effective and adaptable to evolving energy markets.\\\\n\\\\n### **The Future of Renewable Energy Subsidies**\\\\n\\\\nLooking ahead, the future of renewable energy subsidies lies in performance-based incentives and innovative financing mechanisms. These approaches reward efficiency and outcomes rather than blanket financial support. For example, subsidies could be tied to energy output or carbon reductions, ensuring funds are allocated to the most impactful projects.\\\\n\\\\nInternational cooperation will also play a crucial role. Organizations like the United Nations (UN) and World Trade Organization (WTO) can help harmonize subsidy policies, preventing trade disputes and fostering global collaboration. Emerging financial tools, such as green bonds and carbon credits, are poised to complement traditional subsidies, unlocking additional funding for renewable energy initiatives.\\\\n\\\\n### **Conclusion**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies are indispensable in shaping a sustainable future. They have spurred innovation, driven adoption, and delivered tangible economic and environmental benefits across continents. However, as the renewable energy market evolves, subsidy frameworks must adapt to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nPolicymakers and stakeholders must work together to refine subsidy mechanisms, embracing innovation and international collaboration. By doing so, we can build a resilient, equitable, and clean energy future for all.\\\\n\\\\n### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**\\\\n\\\\n**1.

At the international level, the Agreement was hailed as a turning point of collective global action to combat climate change after many rounds of negotiations under the UNFCCC umbrella. For the first time, all countries agreed to keep global average temperature increase to “well below 2°C aiming for 1.5°C” with each contributing their part at a self-determined speed and scale. The so-called ambition mechanism with the Nationally Determined Contributions at the centre was born, embedded in a framework of processes and milestones to enable assessment of progress towards the collective goal.\\\\nSince then, the implementation of the ambition mechanism has proven slower than what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the scientific community’s warnings have grown in urgency and alarm. Indeed, in many parts of the world the impacts of climate change can already be felt, in numerous natural disasters, heat waves, droughts, floods, which threaten the livelihoods of millions.\\\\nAgainst a backdrop of multiple global crises, rising geopolitical tensions and increasing disinformation campaigns, it is important to not only reflect on the gaps of what hasn’t happened but also what has been achieved over the last decade. A closer look at progress will provide important insights into the dynamics of change that we can build on as well as nurture a sense of purpose for the climate community to prepare itself for the next crucial – and undoubtedly difficult – decade.\\\\nThis paper gives an overview of what has been achieved in the last years of international climate policy at the global level along different dimensions of the transition towards a zero emissions world. The focus is deliberately on the positive shifts that can be observed, recognising that these are insufficient to move us to where we need to be but remind us that not all is lost yet. The paper is structured along five thematic areas, covering awareness and civil action, policy and governance, investors and business, as well as the energy and industry sectors. In all of these areas positive shifts are under way. In some cases the shifts are only small and need significant acceleration and scaling. Some have positively surprised us and are already past positive tipping points and “simply” need continuation. All show that change is possible and is happening, sometimes faster than was previously expected or thought even possible. Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 2 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Under each theme we highlight the main positive trends that have been observed in the last decade. It is not meant as a comprehensive compendium but rather a collection of evidence underpinned by data where possible, sometimes anecdotal. The intention is to provide a perspective of change at the global level and not to zoom into specific geographies. However, there are of course significant regional and local differences in many of the observed trends which cannot be considered in depth within the scope of this exercise.\\\\nSHIFT 1 Awarness & civil action Climate change discourse has become mainstream.

Knowledge and awareness on the causes and impacts of climate change has increased across many parts of the population. This is the result of growing media coverage, mainstreaming climate change into education and curricula and not least because the effects of climate change are increasingly felt by many. The decade also saw climate protests and social movements growing in strength, influencing the political debate and keeping businesses and societies on their toes. Advances in attribution science made climate litigation possible.\\\\nClimate change discourse has become mainstream and is a subject of debate in all parts of society, driving social movements and civil action.\\\\nOnly parts of society were meaningfully aware and concerned about climate change. BEFORE NOW 4 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement THE MEDIA NOW COVERS REGULAR STORIES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND REACHES PEOPLE THROUGH DIVERSE CHANNELS, INCLUDING MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS SPECIALISED NEWS CHANNELS.\\\\nThe Media and Climate Change Observatory tracks newspaper coverage of climate change in seven regions around the world ( Figure 1). While coverage goes up and down, there is a clear growth trend since 2015. There are peaks around times of specific events, political, scientific or climatic, as well as dips where other issues (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022) grabbed front pages. An all-time high was observed in 2010, following the disappointing outcomes of the UNFCCC COP in Copenhagen in late 2009, when the costs of the international community\\'s failure to set binding mitigation commitments was underscored by a slew of extreme weather events not seen in almost 100 years (WMO, 2013). Figure 1 2004 – 2022 World Newspaper Coverage of Climate Change or Global Warming Note: Articles per source refers to the average number of articles in a given month across 127 newspaper, radio and TV sources in 58 countries and seven different regions around the world. Source: MeCCO, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nArticles per source 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 5 The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report notes that climate change media coverage across 59 countries has increased from 47,000 articles in 2016 to 2017 to about 87,000 in 2020 to 2021 (IPCC, 2022a). There are of course significant regional differences. While coverage in the Global North is generally more frequent and focusses more on climate science, coverage in the Global South more frequently features links to development, societal changes and impacts on humans and the associated challenges (Hase et al., 2021).\\\\nHowever, there is also a noticeable increase in the level of fake news around climate change related topics. Research on Twitter data during the international climate negotiations between 2014 and 2021 investigated the links between climate change and political polarisation and found a four-fold increase in ideological polarisation since COP21 driven by right wing populist activity (Falkenberg et al., 2022). Also false balance reporting or “bothsideism” that is common in media reporting on climate change leads audiences to doubt the scientific consensus and affects people’s ability to distinguish fact from fiction (Imundo and Rapp, 2022). News fatigue on climate change may also lead to people turning away from the topic.\\\\nAN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT THEIR LIVES.\\\\nCoupled with an increased awareness and understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change and in particular the role that individuals play, there is rising concern that climate change will cause personal harm. In several major economies the number of people who have expressed intense concern that climate change will harm them personally within their lifetime has increased sharply to an average of 37% of people surveyed sharing the concern (Bell et al., 2021).\\\\nResults from a BBC survey (BBC, 2021) covering 17 countries across the world shows that people increasingly perceive climate change as a serious issue. Where in 2014 only around 40% of respondents voiced concern, the share increased to over 60% in 2020. Similarly, the 2021 “Peoples Climate Vote” (UNDP and University of Oxford, 2021) uncovered that the majority of surveyed people across 50 countries considered climate change to be a global emergency. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia this was the case for 85% of respondents, and for 72% of Western Europeans and North Americans, 64% in Arab states, 63% in Latin America, Caribbean and Asia Pacific and 61% in Sub Saharan Africa. At least in principle people also seem to be willing to act on climate change even if it comes at a personal financial expense. For example, over 80% of people in Nigeria and Kenya stated that they would be willing to pay an extra tax to support climate action. In fact, in many emerging and developing economies the vast majority of people surveyed shared this view. At the lower end were some countries in the Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 6 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Global North where numbers dropped to as low as 38% (Leiserowitz et al., 2022) arguably influenced by the fact that in many of these economies measures have already been implemented that affect peoples’ finances. People in the Global North and South see that responsibility for addressing climate change lies mostly with government with an increasing number of people supporting propositions that their governments set ambitious climate targets; concretely 43% of people surveyed in 2015 versus 58% in 2021 (BBC, 2021).\\\\nOn the flipside it is noticeable in public debates that while people theoretically support climate action it is proving rather difficult to introduce concrete measures that would affect the lifestyle of individuals, not least because populist actors use climate change to divide society in the political debate. In some cases, even where public demand for climate action is strong political decision makers follow a few loud or influential actors (see for example (Kinnunen, 2021)). People may be more aware and more knowledgeable about the problem, but at the same time it remains very difficult to channel this into the rapid and far-reaching transitions necessary to not only combat climate change but also prepare for it.\\\\nCLIMATE MOVEMENTS, PROTESTS AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE HAVE KEPT CLIMATE CHANGE HIGH ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND IN PEOPLES’ MINDS PUSHING GOVERNMENTS TO ACT.\\\\nDriven by a growing perception of climate change as a threat to our society, several climate movements have emerged, took to the streets and made headlines. Youth are at the forefront of many of these movements, as young people tend to have a more acute sense of their future being at risk. A highly politized youth contributes to a perception of climate change as a generational conflict, beyond North – South and social divides. Prominent movements, such as Fridays for Future, have originated in the Global North but have sparked protests and climate strikes around the world ( Figure 2).\\\\nCivil disobedience movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil or Last Generation, have drawn attention to the climate crisis in recent years. This contributes to keeping the climate agenda high on people’s perception and also forces political decision makers to address the topic. As a result, governments and societies are permanently reminded of the need for action. In many instances they have started to change course. For example, spurred by climate protests, the German government was sued in constitutional court on the grounds that its 2019 Climate Change Act was an insufficient response to the impending climate crisis. The Constitutional Court found in favour of the plaintiffs and directed the government to revise the law to cut emissions more rapidly in 2030, which it subsequently did (Bundesverfassungsgericht, 2021).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 7 Countries with climate protests Countries without climate protests Figure 2 Countries with climate policy protests since 2022 Source: Carnegie, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAt the same time there are noticeable counter protests by specific groups which fear negative impacts from climate action (see for example the protests by Dutch farmers (Al Jazeera, 2022)). These counter movements are often spurred by populist actors which use civil action and in particular civil disobedience to further polarise people on the topic. In some countries civil spaces are being closed down specifically targeting climate protests (for example, the UK Public Ordinance Act (Laville, 2023)). ADVANCES IN ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE SUPPORTS CIVIL ACTION IN A GROWING NUMBER OF CLIMATE LITIGATION CASES.\\\\nA growing body of scientific literature and evidence on the causes and impacts of climate change as well as solutions is laying the foundation for a better informed political and public discourse. The advances in attribution science in particular have paved the way for an increasing number of climate lawsuits brought against governments and companies (see also Shift 3). As policymakers and companies are slow to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks and change their practices to address the climate crisis, individuals and organisations are increasingly challenging their insufficient climate action in court ( Figure 3).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 8 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Figure 3 Total climate change litigation cases in US and in other countries Source: Setzer and Higham, 2022; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAttribution science looks into the relationship between climate change, natural weather patterns and climate variability. It helps to understand how climate change affects weather events as well as how emissions drive climate change and its impacts. Advances in climate source attribution mark significant progress in being able to understand better the direct links between sources and impact to inform policy and strategies to reduce emissions (Merner, 2023). In particular a publication in 2014 that identified the 90 companies most responsible for global carbon and methane emissions between 1751 and 2010 (Heede, 2014) provided the scientific grounds for legal action (Sato et al., 2023). Although the knowledge and evidence on climate change, its drivers, impacts and solutions with regard to how to address the crisis, is increasing, such evidence, however, is not sufficiently entered into the political and public debate. The scientific discourse often remains in a silo, and a growing number of political actors and their supporters reject it outright.

Where previously discussions focussed on specific sectors and the trade-offs between them, a zero emissions economy perspective is now the norm including in economies in the Global South. Whilst aspirational targets have not yet translated into global emission reductions or aligned mid-term targets, the projected emissions curve has flattened. Climate policies now cover most if not all relevant sectors leading to a significantly improved outlook on the estimated temperature rise albeit not yet aligned with the needed 1.5°C.\\\\nWidely recognised that emissions have to be reduced to zero by every country across the economy.\\\\nPolicy debate centred on incremental emission reductions and trade-offs between sectors and countries.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 10 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF A ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION ECONOMY HAS BECOME THE ACCEPTED NORM AROUND THE WORLD.\\\\nThe global agreement to keep temperature increase to well below 2°C or 1.5°C enshrined in the Paris Agreement, means that CO2 emissions need to be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 (IPCC, 2018, 2022b). Prior to the Paris Agreement and the ensuing IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018, emission targets were typically set at sectoral levels and aggregated to national targets. Often sectors were pitched against each other. A common notion was that reductions would happen sector by sector sequentially in an incremental way. A zero emissions world was not part of the policy discussions.\\\\nBhutan was the first country to set a net-zero target in 2015. Other countries, regions, and cities followed quickly. By end 2021 90% of the global economy was covered by a net zero target stimulating a policy discourse on full decarbonisation that was previously politically not acceptable. The new framing of full decarbonisation has also propagated into sectoral policy making. Coal phase out, 100% zero emission vehicles and zero-emission steel are now considered part of the required policy packages of countries. This transformed the policy toolkit from incentivising incremental change to supporting the 100% transformation. Although the widespread adoption of long term zero emissions targets represents a significant shift in the climate policy discourse, many targets are so far aspirational and not underpinned by sufficient action. The Climate Action Tracker analysed the quality of net zero targets of 41 key emitters and concluded that 74% of global emissions were covered by targets of insufficient or poor quality (Climate Action Tracker, 2022a). Other risks include the assumption of the role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies for both natural and technological approaches given issues of space and permanence of the former and feasibility and scalability of the latter.\\\\nEXPECTATION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR THIS DECADE FLIPPED FROM “EVER INCREASING” TO “AT LEAST FLAT”.\\\\nWith the introduction of the ambition mechanism of the Paris Agreement, for the first time all signatory countries submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to outline their mitigation commitments. Previously, many emerging and developing economies had not set any emission reduction target at all, and many rejected the notion of (binding) mitigation targets considering development needs and the historic responsibility of industrialised countries. The NDCs led to higher ambition in 2030 targets globally. Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 11 In many countries emissions are starting to decline. Emissions projections associated with current policies for the G20, for example, significantly improved since the adoption of the Paris Agreement ( Figure 4). The projected emissions for 2030 are about 15% lower in absolute terms compared to 2015 (Nascimento, Kuramochi and Höhne, 2022). Emissions in 2020 were temporarily low due to the COVID-19 crisis, but a suite of implemented policies, fast uptake of renewable energy and the price shock of gas leads to an outlook of at least flat global emissions from now on. The ever-increasing trend is reversed.\\\\nPeaking global emissions is critical, because with rising annual emissions, temperature increase accelerates each year. With stable emissions, temperature continues to increase but in an almost linear manner. Only with zero emissions, temperature stops to increase.

Besides, projections are expectations on how the future develops. In a politically and economically volatile world things may turn out quite differently.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 12 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN SCOPE AND NOW COVER ALL RELEVANT SECTORS IN MOST COUNTRIES.\\\\nIn the past decade the number and coverage of climate policies has increased significantly (Eskander and Fankhauser, 2020; Nascimento et al., 2022). The expansion of climate policies can be seen on the national level: where previously typically only industrialised and more advanced economies had climate policies in place, this is now the case in many more countries. Expansion also happened at sectoral level, with policies being discussed or in place for all climate relevant sectors. For many years the focus had been on the energy supply, in particular the power sector. In G20 countries the use of various policy instruments has increased steadily over the past two decades (Nascimento et al., 2022). The share of countries that had mitigation policy instruments in place rose across all sectoral categories, albeit to different extents in different sectors and for different policy instruments ( Figure 5). Among G20 countries electricity and heat generation has the greatest number of policies in place, and the agriculture and forestry sector the fewest.\\\\n20 40 60 80 100 Share of G20 countries with instruments in force (%) Direct investments Voluntary approaches Codes and standards Key policy instruments: Fiscal and ﬁnancial incentives Market-based instruments Electricity & Heat 2000 2010 2020 Industry 2000 2010 2020 Land transport 2000 2010 2020 Buildings 2000 2010 2020 Agriculture & Forestry 2000 2010 2020 0 Source: Nascimento et al., 2022; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nFigure 5 Climate policy coverage in different sectors over time Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 13 An increasing number of countries are phasing out or at least plan to phase out fossil fuels in electricity. A total of 75 countries had agreed to phase out coal or not develop new unabated coal power plants in 2022 (IEA, 2023a). In particular outside of China the coal pipeline is shrinking. At the same time many countries are still expanding coal capacity. Globally the coal fleet is still growing albeit at a rate of less than 1% (Global Energy Monitor et al., 2023). The recent energy crisis prompted a switch from gas to coal (Wiatros-Motyka, 2023) and at the same time significant investments into LNG infrastructure. Overall, despite the observed increase in the number and coverage of climate policies, slow progress towards reducing global emissions and meeting the collective Paris climate goals calls for more comprehensive climate change mitigation policies to be adopted and implemented. Several countries have not yet adopted policies to meet their original NDCs, which were set more than seven years ago. Coverage is still incomplete in particular in countries with fast growing emissions (Nascimento and Höhne, 2023). For the Paris Agreement ambition raising mechanism to work, countries need to adopt sufficient policies to meet their targets. Increasing the ambition of targets alone widens the credibility gap between international targets and national action and undermines the Paris Agreement (Nascimento et al., 2023).\\\\nTHE OUTLOOK OF TEMPERATURE INCREASE BY 2100 HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY.\\\\nTemperature projections have continuously improved our outlook. At the time of the adoption of the Paris Agreement, temperature increases by the end of the century from implemented policies of 3.6 to 3.9°C were thought to be likely. Today these high levels are thankfully no longer likely, but a full degree lower: 2.7°C ( Figure 6). The effect of Paris targets led to a significant downward adjustment of projected temperature. The recent wave of national net zero emission targets could, if fully implemented, substantially reduce best estimates of projected global average temperature increase bringing the Paris Agreement goal within reach (Höhne et al., 2021). The most optimistic interpretations of these targets lead to temperature increase as low as 1.7–1.8°C by the end of the century (Höhne et al., 2021; Meinshausen et al., 2022; Rogelj et al., 2023). Although the pathways to these low temperature levels are currently not underpinned by concrete policies, they for the first time give hope that the global temperature increase can indeed be kept to below 2°C.\\\\nThe flipside is clear. Although the projected temperature increase associated with our current policy trajectory is progressively improving, we are still far from the required 1.5°C. If the world continues on its current path the impacts of climate change will be catastrophic. On current emission levels the remaining carbon budget to stay within a 1.5°C increase will be depleted in a few years.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 14 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement 2009 2022 Global temperature increase in 2100 (°C) 2015 Paris Agreement Policies & actions Pledges & targets 2030 targets only 2 4 3.5 3 2.5 Figure 6 Climate Action Tracker’s estimates of global temperature increase has improved over time Source: Climate Action Tracker, 2020; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 15 INVESTORS & BUSINESSES SHIFT 3 Driven by societal pressure, investors and businesses increasingly recognise the climate crisis as a threat to their business models and investment portfolios. Corporate reporting and disclosure on climate has become mainstream – in many cases a legal requirement. At the same time, investors and corporate boards are increasingly actively seeking out business opportunities associated with the low carbon transformation. New business models and innovations are driving change in several markets and shake up traditional players.\\\\nEvery investor and every business feels the pressure to act on climate.\\\\nClimate change is one of many considerations of investors and businesses and still rather a niche topic.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 16 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement CLIMATE IS NOW FIRMLY ON THE AGENDA OF THE FINANCE WORLD. RETAIL INVESTORS ARE DEMANDING AND ASSET MANAGERS ARE INCREASINGLY PROVIDING “SUSTAINABLE” INVESTMENT OPTIONS.\\\\nRetail investors are increasingly demanding “sustainable options”. For instance, a 2020 survey found that two thirds of French and German retail investors want to invest sustainably (Dupre, Bayer and Santacruz, 2020). Despite scandals, accusations of greenwashing, outflows in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and diverse definitions of what can be considered “sustainable”, asset managers are responding to this demand: according to the Financial Times as of July 2023, net assets of global sustainable funds, are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels at USD 2.834 trillion (Ross, 2023), while the sector as a whole is experiencing outflows. The growth is driven by both retail as well as institutional investors, including pensions funds and insurance companies, who respond to increasing awareness and perception of climate change risks of their clients. Nine of ten asset managers believe that the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment strategy will improve returns, and a majority claims this has already proven to be the case. In 2021, 84% of asset owners globally reported to be implementing or evaluating sustainable investment strategies compared to about 53% three years earlier (PwC, 2022). From its niche existence over more than a decade ago, sustainable investing has now become a standard model in the finance world, and climate change has firmly arrived on the agenda of financial institutions. A growing number of asset owners and managers are joining international climate initiatives and are setting dedicated climate targets. 90% of the assets of the 50 largest asset managers are now under a net zero or carbon/climate neutrality target (Kachi and Marquardt, 2022). The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was founded in 2021 and rapidly increased its membership, now representing USD130 trillion in assets (Kachi and Marquardt, 2022). Also the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets is increasingly on the radar (Semieniuk et al., 2022). As a result of these trends, fewer and fewer banks are willing to finance coal mining or coal fired power plants making the financing of new fossil fuel projects increasingly difficult (Green and Vallee, 2022).\\\\nHowever, despite these promising trends and declarations, trillions of USD are still flowing into projects and activities that are not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement sometimes directly undermining climate objectives. In particular, the recent energy crisis prompted profits of oil and gas companies to soar in some cases sparking new investor interest (Bousso, 2023). Unfortunately, many fund managers tend more towards reducing their portfolio’s potential downside risk resulting from climate change rather than directly towards having an actual impact on reducing emissions. In many cases they fail to fund the potentially Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 17 riskier breakthrough technologies that are key for decarbonisation. Moreover, the sustainability labels of investments do not always exclude harmful activities as for example, some ESG funds were found to be invested in fossil assets (Inman, 2023). In any case, much more needs to be done to tighten up definitions of “sustainable” and to take advantage of the opportunities that decarbonisation offers. This will be critical in order for the trillions in invested assets to provide momentum and fund the trillions needed to decarbonise the global economy. CLIMATE LITIGATION IS A GROWING RISK TOWARDS DIRTY BUSINESS MODELS AND COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO WAKE UP TO TRANSITION RISKS.\\\\nClimate litigation, supported by improved attribution science (see Shift 1), is increasingly recognised as an effective way to hold companies accountable. The first corporate climate litigation case was recorded in 1995, and from 2000 a growing number of lawsuits were filed against oil, gas and electricity companies in the US (Sato et al., 2023). According to research by Grantham Institute, since 2015 the number of climate change related lawsuits against governments and companies has more than doubled to a total number of 2000 cases globally, a quarter of which in the last three years (Setzer and Higham, 2022). In 2022, legal action was filed in particular against fossil fuel corporations outside the US. Increasingly also companies in other sectors are targeted, including in food and agriculture, transport, plastics and finance. The claims particularly focus on “climate washing” of providing false or misleading information on climate commitments, failure to disclose climate risks or making false product claims (Sato et al., 2023). Climate litigation is increasingly considered an additional transition risk by investors. For some years financial markets have already been considering climate related risks, physical and transitional, and started to integrate these into their evaluation and decision processes. Evidence suggests that litigation can affect company performance. Even filing a lawsuit can make a difference. One recent study found that being brought to court – even before an unfavourable judgement can reduce the firm value of carbon majors on average by 0.57%, increasing to 1.5% following unfavourable judgements (Sato et al., 2023). While climate litigation led to some positive outcomes that prominently exposed companies’ responsibility for climate change, for example the ruling against RWE or Shell Netherlands (Weller and Tran, 2022) and contributes to an increased risk awareness of companies as well as diversification of business towards more sustainable activities (Böff, 2023), it has not yet led to a significant shift away from dirty business models of affected companies or their peers. More needs to be done to change the trajectory of whole sectors – not only in selected jurisdictions but Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 18 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement also around the world. And although climate risks are increasingly understood, such risks remain in the shadow of continued promising (short term) returns of high carbon investments.\\\\nAS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL PRESSURE, COMPANIES INCREASINGLY PREPARE CLIMATE PLANS AND IMPROVE THEIR CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURE.\\\\nThe interest of investors in climate risks as well as an increasingly aware public pushed companies to talk about climate impacts and risks of their activities. A growing number of companies is setting climate targets, mainly emission reduction targets as well as increasingly net zero targets. In 2015 only 30% of companies had set emission reduction targets and only 2% net zero targets. More recent data shows that currently of the world’s largest 2000 publicly listed companies by revenue nearly half have set or in the process of setting a net zero target (Hale et al., 2021).\\\\n2023 Net Zero Stocktake 2023 Number of net zero targets 0 200 600 1000 2022 Net Zero Stocktake 2022 2021 Black et al., 2021 Figure 7 Decarbonisation targets set by publicly listed companies globally Source: Net Zero Tracker, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nReporting on climate change performance and risks is also increasingly mainstream for companies. Among the Standard&Poors 500 companies more than half have started to disclose climate risks in annual reports, 71% disclose carbon emissions data in other reports or on their websites (Conference-board.org, 2022). The Financial Stability Board created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 19 (TCFD) driving standardisation and scrutiny in this area. Increasingly countries are moving towards legally mandating reporting on environmental and climate related risks such as the EU (European Commission, 2023). The climate litigation cases, which particularly target misleading disclosure and information provided by companies, are forcing more scrutiny on reporting practices and corporate claims and are helping to call out greenwashing. Competition among companies, in particular within the same sector, increases pressure on peers. Although not yet a race to the top, competition on climate performance is mounting.\\\\nReporting on greenhouse gas emissions has moved from typically reporting on only scope 1 (direct) and 2 (purchased energy) emissions to increasingly include scope 3 emissions covering the entire value chain of products and services. This is particularly relevant as on average scope 3 emissions account for 75% of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions (Hadziosmanovic, Rahimi and Bhatia, 2022a). According to CDP data, the number of companies reporting on scope 3 emission increased from 936 in 2010 to 3,317 companies in 2021 ( Figure 8). Interestingly in 2021, the majority of companies appeared to track scope 3 emissions but did not agree to publicly report on them.\\\\nFigure 8 Number of companies that publicly disclose Scope 3 emissions Publicly disclosed with scope 3 emissions reported Not made publicly available Publicly disclosed with no scope 3 emissions reported Number of companies 0 4000 8000 12000 2010 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2011 2013 1981 2567 4492 2229 2038 2184 1599 1199 2054 1824 1509 1368 1016 4310 1952 1738 1515 1316 Number of companies reporting on GHG emissions 0 4000 8000 12000 936 938 1029 1438 1229 1445 1876 1704 1640 2012 3,317 companies 936 companies Source: Hadziosmanovic, Rahimi and Bhatia, 2022b; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 20 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Corporate greenwashing is however still ubiquitous. The majority of net zero targets are not aligned with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement and are not underpinned by sufficient action. Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative on corporate climate action, found that despite long term targets, there continue to be major gaps in companies’ medium term rapid reduction targets, a lack of accounting for scope 3 emissions, and “only 5% of focus companies explicitly commit to align their capex plans with their long-term GHG reduction targets” (Climate Action 100+, 2022). Further, the role of carbon offsets in companies’ decarbonisation strategies is problematic as offsetting one’s own emissions detracts from stopping high carbon activities and rethinking harmful business models. NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW PLAYERS AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES HAVE LED TO A GREATER RECOGNITION THAT MAIN POLLUTERS, IN PARTICULAR, NEED TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO SURVIVE.\\\\nIn the past decades many smaller green industry players have actively pushed the development and commercialisation of technologies and services, in particular in the energy sector. The perseverance of these companies, which often battled against unfavourable regulations, bureaucratic hurdles and skewed markets, led to the establishment of green industry across the world. In some cases this happened by forming green advocacy alliances with different actors that eventually pushed governments to change the rules (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006). The growth in green businesses resulted in an increasing number of green jobs. While the majority of these jobs are associated with the energy sector ( Figure 9) such jobs have emerged across other sectors including finance, fashion and transport (Kimbrough, 2021).\\\\nIn many sectors, new players or visionary incumbent companies have pushed the introduction of climate friendly technologies, and in some cases this has led to a shift in the market where others are forced to follow to remain competitive. This can be seen, for example, in the automotive industry with e-mobility, as well as with clean steel, and heat pumps. Another shift indicator is the amount of investment flowing into green or climate technologies. For example, venture capital investment into climate technologies globally has increased sharply since 2015 ( Figure 10).\\\\nDespite noticeable positive trends and shifts, the majority of the economy has not shifted to a climate aligned model. High carbon activities remain profitable and continue to attract investments, and radical changes in business models are not happening at the necessary scale. Active lobbying by companies and their sector representatives has successfully stalled ambitious climate policies in many jurisdictions (Waldersee, 2022).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 21 Figure 9 Evolution of global renewable energy employment Figure 10 Value of venture capital investment in climate technology worldwide Venture capital going to green or climate technologies (%) 0 4 8 12 2021 2019 2023 2017 2015 Solar heating/ cooling Wind energy Others Bioenergy Hydropower Solar photovoltaic Number of jobs (million) 0 4 8 12 2012 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 Source: IRENA and ILO, 2022; rRe-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nSource: Dealroom.co, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 22 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ENERGY SUPPLY SHIFT 4 Renewable energy as the backbone of the energy transition has become the new normal, and the question of phasing out fossil fuels is no longer a question of “if” but “when”. Energy systems with large shares of wind and solar are increasingly the reality on the ground in many parts of the world and improving energy access for many.\\\\nRenewables reached cost parity with fossils, and power systems are shifting to decentralised, flexible models.\\\\nRenewables were not cost competitive and with low to medium penetration in base load capacity driven markets.\\\\nBEFORE NOW NewClimate Institute November 2023 23 PREDICTIONS ON GLOBAL RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT WERE CONTINUOUSLY OUTSTRIPPED BY THE ACCELERATED REAL UPTAKE OF WIND AND SOLAR AS THEY REACHED AND BLEW PAST COST PARITY WITH FOSSILS.\\\\nOver two decades ago, renewables, specifically solar and wind, were associated with high costs limiting their accessibility in particular in finance constrained economies in the Global South. Since then, costs have decreased much faster than what had been predicted or thought realistic. The cost of solar, onshore and offshore wind fell by 60-90% in the last ten years (IPCC, 2021; RMI, 2023). New renewables are now cheaper than new fossils in 90% of the world and the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation. Despite temporary cost increases for renewables in some contexts, the gap to fossil based power generation continues to grow as prices of fuel and carbon rise even faster. New build onshore wind and solar projects are now 40% cheaper than the global benchmark for new coal and gas fired power (BloombergNEF, 2022). This has resulted in significant investments into renewable energy which surpasses fossil fuel investments by a factor of five (IEA, 2023e). New renewables are also cheaper than running existing coal or gas fire plants in half of the world which means that, on balance, shutting down fossil plants and building new renewables would save the world trillions (Allen, 2023). Source: RMI, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nFigure 11 Projected global solar deployment Actual solar deployment 2000 2040 Annual capacity addition (GW) BNEF 2015 BNEF 2020 0 300 200 100 2030 2020 2010 IEA 2017 IEA 2016 EIA 2017 Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 24 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Past predictions on the uptake of renewables were repeatedly outstripped by reality. Nobody had been able to predict how fast these technologies would grow, especially solar energy. For 20 years the International Energy Agency predicted linear growth of solar when in reality growth happened exponentially ( Figure 11).\\\\nAt the same time, renewables continue to be constrained by grid and system limitations in many parts of the world, where investments and reforms lag behind potential deployment rates. From a systems balancing perspective developing wind and solar capacities in parallel is critical. The development of wind, however, has stagnated in many countries often related to barriers, such as permitting issues, that drive up the costs of projects. Overall, despite the positive technology developments investment into fossil-based power generation continues. In particular the recent energy crisis prompted a shift back to coal and new investments into fossil infrastructure and exploration, including coal, gas and oil (Climate Action Tracker, 2022b). A PARADIGM SHIFT ON MULTIPLE LEVELS TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS STARTED THAT CANNOT BE REVERSED. THE ENERGY SYSTEM HAS CHANGED AND SO HAVE THE ACTORS.\\\\nWith the incorporation of increasing variable renewable sources, especially wind and solar, the energy system is transforming itself from one dominated by base load power plants to one with increasing decentralisation and flexibility. This shift is underpinned by the adoption and readiness of flexibility options, including demand response measures, large scale batteries and dispatchable renewable energy. Fears of intermittent renewables especially during peak load hours are gradually being overcome as renewables-based power systems prove to be reliable (Quak et al., 2018).\\\\nThe power system has become increasingly democratised and decentralised allowing new actors to become part of the solution. Feed-in schemes or net metering, amongst others, have enabled millions of households to actively participate in the energy transition by installing solar panels or other smaller scale renewable technologies. The digitalisation is supporting this market transformation turning more and more people into prosumers to support the transition. At the industry level, the last years have seen a surge in new manufacturing capacities for renewable energy technologies. For solar energy as well as batteries, the existing and announced projects are now sufficient to align with the IEA’s net zero scenario in 2030. Gaps remain for wind, heat pumps and electrolysers where growth has been more stagnant (IEA, 2023d). Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 25 Figure 12 Manufacturing capacity for renewable technologies 2022 2021 Installed manufacturing capacity: As of late 2022 Announced projects: Additional to end-Q1 2023 Gap to NZE NZE Scenario deployment needs in 2030 Solar PV Electrolysers 0 150 100 50 Heat pumps Wind Batteries Share of 2030 NZE Scenario deployment (%) Source: IEA, 2023d; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nHowever, there are still a significant number of powerful players in the energy markets world-wide that actively resist or delay the energy transition to maximise gains from current business models. This includes in particular fossil fuel dependent countries and large energy cooperations which use their respective powers to block or delay action. And whilst manufacturing capacity for renewable technologies is ramping up, critical gaps in manufacturing capacities and raw materials to enable the zero-carbon transformation remain (IEA, 2021). Broader sustainability issues associated with the production of technologies and raw materials make reconciliation of climate and sustainability goals difficult. DUE TO WIDE AVAILABILITY OF DECENTRALISED RENEWABLES ENERGY ACCESS HAS GROWN SUPPORTING ACHIEVEMENT OF IMPORTANT SDG GOALS. The energy transition has not only delivered cleaner electricity but has also enabled a larger share of the population to have access to electricity. Back in 1990, around 71% of the world population had access to electricity, increasing to 83% in 2010. The last decade saw a jump almost twice as fast as the previous decade reaching over 90% in 2020 ( Figure 13). Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 26 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Electricity access through decentralised renewable energy systems has played a significant role by providing 59 million people access to tier 1 (energy access, including lighting and phone charging) systems and 15 million to tier 2 (additionally power energy-efficient household appliances such as TV electricity) by the end of 2022 (Reynolds and Paixão, 2022a). The number of people with “improved energy access through an off-grid solar product” has also bounced back from 101 million in 2021 to 104 million by the end of 2022 (Reynolds and Paixão, 2022b). The number had declined between 2019 and 2021 due to COVID-19 and supply chain issues (IEA et al., 2023a).\\\\nHowever, we are not there yet. In order to reach the goal of universal access by 2030 the annual growth rate must increase further from the 0.6% percentage points seen in recent years to 1% point per year until 2030 (IEA et al., 2023b). As recognised by the UN, a significant effort will be needed to provide stable energy access to people living in least developed and in fragile and conflict-affected countries (UNSD, 2022).\\\\nFigure 13 Percentage of population with access to electricity Population with access to electricity (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 2010 2012 2014 2016 2020 2018 Brazil US China India World Afghanistan Haiti Rwanda Note: Electricity defined as an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.\\\\nSource: World Bank, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 27 ELECTRIFICATION & INDUSTRY SHIFT 5 Actors across all economic sectors are beginning to realise that electrification through electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electric heat in industry is central to the decarbonisation and start to act accordingly. Innovation and investment has advanced significantly in the so-called “hard to abate” sectors like shipping and heavy industry.\\\\nElectrification in transport and buildings has progressed significantly and all industry is now working on zero carbon strategies.\\\\nEnergy demand and hard to abate sectors hid behind the energy supply sector to decarbonise first.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 28 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY AND IS SET TO BECOME THE NEW NORMAL.\\\\nElectric passenger cars have started to displace the internal combustion engine (ICE) and are now the new standard in some parts of the world. Major car manufacturers have made the decision to move to 100% electrified cars. The shift happened despite fierce lobbying by parts of the industry in particular in the traditional automotive base of Germany, eventually pushed by the success story of new players such as Tesla among others.\\\\nSeveral countries have now set targets and dates to phase out combustion engines including the European Economic Area (EEC), Canada, Chile and several US states (ICCT, 2023). Compared to the situation ten years ago this policy commitment, driven by a fast-changing market, was not conceivable. The growth of electric vehicles has surpassed all expectations. The latest IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) changed their global outlook of the share of electric car sales under existing policies and targets from a previous 25% to 35% in 2030 (IEA, 2022c). The growth is set to be exponential ( Figure 14) with the share of electric cars in new registrations at 14% in 2022, an expected 18% in 2023 (IEA, 2023b). Past growth is in line with what is needed for 1.5°C in the sector (Boehm et al., 2023).\\\\nFigure 14 Share of electric in light-duty vehicles Electriﬁcation of vehicles (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 2010 2040 Current trend Pace needed to reach targets 100% 2022 2023 2030 target 14% 18% 2035 target 95% 75% Historical data IEA projection Source: Boehm et al., 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 29 Other vehicles, such as buses and trucks, are also moving towards electrification albeit at a slower pace. In 2022 840 different battery electric buses and trucks were available in the market, which is dominated by China (60%), the USA (20%) and the EU (15%) and which seems to outpace hydrogen alternatives (IEA, 2023b). However, the shift to electric vehicles is not yet global but limited to advanced economies, mainly in the global North as well as China. In many countries the widespread adoption of electric vehicles still faces significant cost barriers, in particular in places where second hand markets dominate. Also, investment in charging infrastructure is lagging behind market developments. Beyond that, the necessary shift towards less car use, i.e., a reduction in the overall number of vehicles, is not yet happening across the board.\\\\nBATTERY STORAGE SAW SIGNIFICANT PRICE DECREASE AND IS NOW COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.\\\\nBattery storage technologies are critical for the renewable energy transition. They are needed as stationary solutions to solve the intermittency issues of variable renewable sources in the power and industry sector; mobile battery storage is of course critical for the electrification of the transport sector. For the latter the discussion on battery storage, costs and ranges has long been a major barrier for the wider uptake of electric vehicles.\\\\nIn the last decade, lithium-ion batteries, the dominant battery technology, have become commercially viable with a cost decline of 80% ( Figure 15). Battery prices are the main driver of EV costs and hence an important, if not the most important, factor for consumers. The recent price levels of batteries have pushed total cost of ownership to comparable levels with internal combustion engines (ICE).\\\\nNew developments in battery technology are expected to reduce costs even further. Alternatives could include solid-state batteries or sodium-ion batteries which have the advantage to rely on more widely available materials than lithium-ion based technologies. The development of new batteries is accelerated by policies in many parts of the world to incentivise investments into technology development and manufacturing capacity. In addition, concerns about supplies of important battery materials – including cobalt and lithium – are driving the search for alternatives (Crownhart, 2023).\\\\nWhilst the recent developments and trends are promising the availability of long-term storage remains a key barrier to the deep decarbonisation of the energy sector. In addition, environmental and human rights concerns associated with the sourcing of raw materials, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt, are critical issues yet to be solved.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 30 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement 2012 2022 Cost of batteries (USD/kWh) 0 800 400 2018 2016 2014 2020 cost decline 80% Figure 15 Cost of lithium-ion batteries between 2021 – 2022 Source: BloombergNEF, 2021; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nDEPLOYMENT OF HEAT PUMPS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR IS SOARING.\\\\nIn the building sector electrification has also been progressing with heat pumps as a key technology for the decarbonisation of heating demand. Globally, the sale of heat pumps saw double digit growth in 2021 and 2022 driven by increased policy support and incentives (IEA, 2023c) . Financial incentives for heat pumps are now available in over 30 countries which account for more than 70% of the current global heating demand (IEA, 2022a). Particularly in Europe sales of heat pumps have been soaring in the last decade with annual growth rates of 34% and 38% in 2021 and 2022 respectively ( Figure 16).\\\\nBeyond buildings, large-scale heat pumps are increasingly being tested for district heating systems (Energiewendebauen, 2023). Also, for industrial heat applications, in particular in the paper, food and chemicals industries, heat pumps are discussed as viable decarbonisation options (IEA, 2022b). About 50% of industry’s heat demand could already be electrified with existing low temperature heat technology, new electric high temperature heat technology is emerging (Kavanagh, 2022).\\\\nAt the same time the building as well as industry sectors are nowhere near alignment with the 1.5°C temperature goal and lagging far behind the energy supply sector. New building regulations in most parts of the world are not climate proof, and renovation rates of existing building stock is far too slow.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 31 Figure 16 Sales of heat pumps in Europe 2013 – 2022 Sales of heat pumps (million) 0 1 2 3 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2022 +34% +38% +10% Source: Rosenow and Gibb, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nDEEP DECARBONISATION MOVING INTO FOCUS IN HARD TO ABATE INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORT SECTORS.\\\\nA decade ago full decarbonisation of the hard to abate industry sectors or international shipping and aviation was not under discussion. The common assumption was that other sectors would decarbonise first and that incremental emission reductions would suffice in the meantime. The picture now has changed completely. In the emission intensive industry sector, the need to go to zero carbon is now recognised by many and several companies are now working towards this. For example, the number of hydrogen steel plants has been increasing in recent years with currently 60 plants being planned worldwide (Green Steel Tracker, 2023).\\\\nNoteworthy are also advances in the shipping sector where all-electric cruise (Doll, 2022) and container ships (The Maritime Executive, 2023) are hitting the oceans and waterways. Some major shipping companies have committed to zero carbon fuels in the future (e.g., Maersk) likely to push the competition in a similar direction as regulation is tightening in the sector. Overall, decarbonisation solutions in the hard to abate sectors are still in their infancy and far from widespread adoption. Much more innovation for further electrification shifts is needed. The emissions impact of the fledgling climate action is not yet visible, and several sectors are lagging behind, including aviation, cement, chemicals and aluminium.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 32 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ” WELL, IN OUR COUNTRY,” SAID ALICE “YOU’D GENERALLY GET TO SOMEWHERE ELSE—IF YOU RUN VERY FAST FOR A LONG TIME, AS WE’VE BEEN DOING.” “A SLOW SORT OF COUNTRY!” SAID THE QUEEN. “NOW, HERE, YOU SEE, IT TAKES ALL THE RUNNING YOU CAN DO, TO KEEP IN THE SAME PLACE. IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU MUST RUN AT LEAST TWICE AS FAST AS THAT!” NewClimate Institute November 2023 33 CONCLUDING REMARKS We are not running alongside Alice in Wonderland but our climate policy environment seems to follow similar principles. During the last decade many things shifted in the right direction. In some areas shifts happened at a very fast pace (electric mobility), often faster than had been predicted (solar deployment). Some involved deeper systemic shifts (power systems) that cannot be reversed anymore, yet others are rather fledgling but still noticeable (industry). Overall, whilst progress is happening and solutions to avert the climate crisis are being implemented globally, the climate crisis itself is accelerating at an ever-faster pace, threatening to cancel out the progress made. So we need to run faster.\\\\nOn the positive side, the many shifts highlighted in the paper show that we can run fast, that change is possible and can happen unexpectedly, instigated by new actors (global youth), using new strategies (climate litigation) pushing governments and companies to act. All this gives hope that the Paris Agreement goal to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C is still within reach. Temperature projections over the years underline this showing that under current policies temperature increase would reach 2.7°C. This is nowhere near where we need to be but at least a full degree lower than predictions a decade earlier.\\\\nNeedless to say, it is critical to reinforce current trends and accelerate climate action on all levels. Change needs to happen everywhere, at the same time and very fast, in some areas a great deal faster than seems realistic today. Digitalisation and new technologies can help but come with their own set of issues that we need to deal with. Arguments about trade-offs, in particular when it comes to broader sustainability issues, cannot and should not be used to slow down action, rather more innovation and deeper change is needed to find equitable and sustainable solutions. We need to think out of the box, think the impossible, find new alliances and get all society behind the cause. There will be systemic questions that need answering not least as many of the positive shifts we have seen are based on a growth paradigm which far exceeds planetary boundaries. Consumption patterns have started to change in some areas and consumers in wealthier (and younger) parts of society are shifting to more sustainable habits, however, unhealthy consumption patterns remain strong and are continued to be reinforced by our economic systems. There are many critical areas where shifts have not yet happened or have been reversed. Deforestation, biodiversity loss, societal equity and justice questions need urgent responses. And we need to build our resilience and adaptive capacity as climate Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 34 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement change is happening and most societies are wholly unprepared for it. It is prudent to, as far as this is even possible, hedge against the risk of sliding into an intensifying climate crisis as we are moving dangerously close to climate tipping points. While the situation appears daunting and the high-level political agenda is not set for constructive cooperation, we can draw strength from the many positive developments. At the technical level cooperation is continuing, and globally our technical capacities and knowledge have been increasing. We know what to do and are ready to act where windows of opportunity arise and the geopolitical situation makes way. It is easy to feel disheartened about our current set of challenges but history has also shown that the future is not predictable and full of disruptive surprises.

Global landscape of renewable energy finance 2023\\\\n\\\\n#### Newsletter\\\\n\\\\nGo\\\\n\\\\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies, including energy efficiency, reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022. However, annual investments need to at least quadruple to remain on track to achieve the 1.5°C Scenario in IRENA’s _[World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Mar/World-Energy-Transitions-Outlook-2023)_. Investment in renewable energy was also unprecedented – at USD 0.5 trillion – but represented less than one third of the average investment needed each year. Investments are also not flowing at the pace or scale needed to accelerate progress towards universal energy access; investments in off-grid renewable energy solutions in 2021 – at USD 0.5 billion – fell far short of the USD 2.3 billion needed annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including mini-grids).\\\\n\\\\nThis third edition of the biannual joint report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) analyses investment trends by technology, sector, region, source of finance and financial instrument in the period 2013-2020 and provides preliminary data for 2021-2022. It identifies financing gaps to support informed policy making for the deployment of renewables at the scale needed to accelerate the energy transition.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that investments have become further concentrated in specific technologies and uses, and in a small number of countries/regions. It underscores the need to direct public funds to regions and countries that have considerable untapped potential but find it difficult to attract investment. Funding must be focused on supporting energy transition infrastructure development, as well as enabling policy frameworks to drive investment and address persistent socio-economic gaps.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional analyses\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\n*   [### Global geothermal market and technology

To help address the knowledge gap, we developed an inventory of public financial support for renewable energy generation and integration by G20 governments, which dominate renewable deployment. G20 governments provided at least USD 168 billion in public financial support for renewable power in 2023, less than one third of G20 fossil fuel subsidies that year. Advanced G20 economies and China accounted for 95% of renewable power support. Where disaggregated data was available, support was directed mostly to solar and wind, but almost half of the support targeted multiple technologies or did not specify.\\\\n\\\\nAssuming current investment and support patterns remain consistent to 2030, we estimate that public support may need to double to around USD 336 billion per year to achieve the pledge made at the 28th UN Climate Change Conference (COP 28) to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. This would still be lower than current G20 fossil fuel subsidies (USD 535 billion in 2023). Lower income countries are at risk of getting left behind in the clean energy transition and will need grants and concessional finance to catch up. The benefits of increasing support to renewable power extend beyond achieving climate goals: increased energy access and less air pollution, price volatility, and geopolitical risk relative to fossil fuels.\\\\n\\\\nRelated\\\\n-------\\\\n\\\\n*   [### Mapping India\\'s Energy Policy 2023 Report March 11, 2024](https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/mapping-india-energy-policy-2023 \\\\\"Mapping India&#039;s Energy Policy 2023\\\\\")\\\\n*   [### Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker](https://fossilfuelsubsidytracker.org/ \\\\\"Links\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nShare this page:\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20 \\\\\"Share via BlueSky\\\\\")\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20&title=Public%20Financial%20Support%20for%20Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20and%20Integration%20in%20the%20G20%20Countries \\\\\"Share via Linkedin\\\\\")\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Public%20Financial%20Support%20for%20Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20and%20Integration%20in%20the%20G20%20Countries&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iisd.org%2Fpublications%2Freport%2Frenewable-energy-support-g20&via=iisd_news \\\\\"Share via X\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nParticipating experts\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\n[#### Tara Laan Lead, Incentivizing Renewables](https://www.iisd.org/people/tara-laan \\\\\"Find out more about Tara Laan\\\\\")[#### Nhat Do Policy Analyst](https://www.iisd.org/people/nhat-do \\\\\"Find out more about Nhat Do\\\\\")[#### Steven Haig Policy Advisor](https://www.iisd.org/people/steven-haig \\\\\"Find out more about Steven Haig\\\\\")[#### Indira Urazova Policy Advisor](https://www.iisd.org/people/indira-urazova \\\\\"Find out more about Indira Urazova\\\\\")[#### Eduardo Posada Policy Analyst](https://www.iisd.org/people/eduardo-posada \\\\\"Find out more about Eduardo Posada\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nReport details\\\\n--------------\\\\n\\\\nTopic[Climate Change Mitigation](https://www.iisd.org/topics/climate-change-mitigation)[Energy](https://www.iisd.org/topics/energy)[Governance and Multilateral Agreements](https://www.iisd.org/topics/governance-and-multilateral-agreements)[Just Transition](https://www.iisd.org/topics/just-transition)[Subsidies](https://www.iisd.org/topics/subsidies)Focus area[Climate](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/climate)[Act Together](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/act-together)[Economies](https://www.iisd.org/focus-areas/economies)Publisher IISD Copyright IISD, 2024\\\\n\\\\nYou might also be interested in\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n[### Advancing a Fair and Funded Transition Away from Fossil Fuels This briefing outlines recommendations for countries to advance the transition away from fossil fuels at SB 62 in Bonn and COP 30 in Belem.

NDCs and renewable energy targets in 2023: Tripling renewable power by 2030\\\\n\\\\n#### Newsletter\\\\n\\\\nGo\\\\n\\\\nThis report reviews renewable energy targets in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement as of the end of October 2023, ahead of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), and assesses their level of ambition against IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario and the goal of tripling renewables in the power sector by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nFor developing countries, the report identifies those targets that are conditional on financial assistance and determines the minimum level of financing needed to support their achievement. It also examines the extent to which renewable energy targets in NDCs are aligned with those set out in national plans and policies, and whether these are reflected in laws, policies or roadmaps and plans.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that renewable energy ambitions within NDCs are not only insufficient, but also fall short of what countries have committed to in domestic policies that exist outside the framework of the Paris Agreement (national laws, policies, roadmaps, plans, strategies). As per IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway, and the COP28 pledge to triple renewable power globally, renewable power generation capacity in the G20 countries alone would need to grow from less than 3 terawatts (TW) in 2022 to 9.4 TW by 2030, accounting for 80% of the global total. The commitments made in NDCs account for less than half of that required to align with the tripling renewables pledge, and those made in national energy plans and policies fall short by 30%. The report also notes that developing countries – mainly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) – plan to double their renewable installed capacity, compared to 2022, to more than 110 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. However, more than half of this is conditional on international support in the form of financing, technical assistance, technology transfer or capacity building.\\\\n\\\\nRelated content\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\n*   ![Image 4](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/May/Renewable-Energy-Projects-in-Central-Asia-Tile.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=00BD908FDCBCDDE06B371751E3E415BC)[### IRENA Issues Call for Renewable Energy Projects in Central Asia](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/May/IRENA-Issues-Call-for-Renewable-Energy-Projects-in-Central-Asia)26 May 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 5](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/May/I-ACT-Youth-Capacity-tile.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=4CF6433A740EBDECD21B3EEEAED675E2)[### I ACT: Building Youth’s Capacity Through Peer-to-Peer Learning](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/May/I-ACT-Building-Youths-Capacity-Through-Peer-to-Peer-Learning)20 May 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 6](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Article/2025/Jun/IIW-Wrap-Up-Article-Tile-Image.png?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=0742F0A8E76D6B82469D5DF9B0032BDC)[### Five Key Takeaways from the IRENA Innovation Week 2025](https://www.irena.org/News/articles/2025/Jun/Innovation-Week-2025-Wrap-Up)16 June 2025[Articles](https://www.irena.org/search?contentType=922d770c-a4e6-4222-9483-3011736e2380&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 7](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Press-Release/2025/Jun/GCEP-release-tile.png?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=833798202338C649E3C2C3F13285897E)[### IRENA and Brazil to Host First Global Energy Planning Summit](https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jun/IRENA-and-Brazil-to-Host-First-Global-Energy-Planning-Summit)2 June 2025[Press Releases](https://www.irena.org/Search?contentType=8632933e-7fb6-4dbe-8407-fe1354cdc20d&orderBy=Date)   \\\\n*   ![Image 8](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Images/IRENA/Agency/Blog/2025/May/Extreme-weather-and-renewables.jpg?w=216&h=123&as=1&bc=ffffff&cc=1&hash=825301013F07368184465BF8CB438E56)[### Strategies for Resilience -

INVESTMENT POLICIES FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES H I G H L I G H T S • UNCTAD\\'s World Investment Report 2023 highlights a worrisome increase in the SDG investment gap, surpassing $4 trillion annually in developing countries alone, with energy investment needs estimated at $2.2 trillion per year. Successful energy transition necessitates significant investment in renewable energy projects, the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions. At the recent World Investment Forum (WIF), global stakeholders emphasized the need to redirect net-zero finance toward developing economies. • Existing policy frameworks aimed at promoting investment in the energy transition are notably inadequate, especially in poorer nations. Around the world, two-thirds of countries have adopted renewable energy policies. However, only half of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and one-third of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have done so. While developed and emerging economies have integrated private investment promotion mechanisms into over 70 per cent of their renewable energy policies, the same holds true for only 24 per cent of policies in LDCs and 17 per cent of those in SIDS. • While most developed economies use targeted investment promotion policies, many developing countries use generic tax incentives – applicable to investment in any industry – that do not address the specificities of energy investment projects. In recent times, auctions and tenders for renewable energy projects have gained traction across all country groups. • The value of fossil fuel subsidies has reached a staggering $1 trillion, far surpassing support for renewable energy. Gradually phasing out these subsidies, although complex for many countries, would incentivize investments in renewables. • Policies to encourage the phased retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure are also needed, as emphasized during the WIF. However, thermal power plants will continue to play a role in ensuring energy security for many countries in the years to come. To curb their environmental impact, broader adoption of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, cofiring, and low-carbon fuels is key. At present, policies and initiatives to promote investment in such technologies are predominantly confined to developed countries and large emerging economies. • The Global Action Compact for Investment in Sustainable Energy for All, proposed by UNCTAD in the World Investment Report 2023, aims to address these challenges and achieve a balanced energy transition. It emphasizes three key objectives: achieving climate targets, ensuring affordable energy access for all, and maintaining energy security. NOVEMBER 2023 ISSUE 26 2 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Introduction Climate change is an existential threat to human society. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that the world is likely to reach global warming of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels within 15 years unless we achieve drastic cuts in carbon emissions now. This would result in large-scale drought, famine, heat stress, species die-off, loss of entire ecosystems and habitable land, throwing more than 100 million into poverty (IPCC, 2022a). The experts, however, have also pointed out that we have the technologies and policy tools to achieve climate change mitigation, but solutions should be scaled up rapidly (IPCC, 2022b). For this to happen, the policy response should be commensurate with the challenge. The energy system is at the centre of the policy response to climate change and national policies are crucial for driving the shift towards clean energy. The clean energy transition needs to accelerate, while at the same time, energy access needs to expand significantly. In this context, emerging and developing economies, in particular, are faced with the dual challenge of ensuring energy security and meeting the growing energy needs of their expanding population, while simultaneously speeding up mitigation solutions and cutting carbon emissions. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, international investment in renewable energy has nearly tripled. However, this growth has predominantly occurred in developed countries. According to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2023, the investment gap across all SDG sectors has increased from $2.5 trillion in 2015 to more than $4 trillion per year today. The largest gaps are in energy, water, and transport infrastructure. Energy investment needs in developing countries are estimated at $2.2 trillion per year (WIR23). Figure 1: Key technologies of the clean energy transition of the power sector Source: UNCTAD 3 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M As discussed during various sessions of the UNCTAD World Investment Forum (WIF) 2023, in parallel with this big push for investment in renewable energy, the clean energy transition will require the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions (box 1). These solutions integrate environmental technologies to decrease CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants, such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies, the use of clean fuels, as well as technologies that increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants (figure 1). Box 1: The Climate Finance and Investment Track at the World Investment Forum The 8th edition of UNCTAD’s World Investment Forum (WIF) took place in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October 2023, and saw the convergence of 8,000 participants, including government officials, international organizations, policymakers, 700 CEOs and investors, sovereign wealth funds, sustainable stock exchanges and key capital markets actors. The WIF featured a dedicated Climate Finance and Investment Track, which included the second COP28 preparatory Global Dialogue and several Investment Focused Events, to continue the preparation of decisions for adoption at COP28, with a particular focus on climate finance and investment. The Global Dialogues and Investment Focused Events were agreed by the Parties at COP27 with the aim to identify challenges, barriers and roadblocks in accelerating the just energy transition; develop actionable solutions and innovations for policies, institutional arrangements, finance and technologies; and explore opportunities to direct finance flows towards the implementation of mitigation projects on the ground. Some of the issues discussed during the WIF in this track included: • Net zero finance and financing the just energy transition; • Carbon markets; • FDI, hydrogen and the greening of emerging markets; • Strategic minerals for decarbonization; • Stock exchange action on climate disclosure; • The role of trade and investment policies in promoting climate action and boosting NDCs implementation; • Financial instruments for early retirement of fossil-fuel-assets; • Sustainable infrastructure. Source: UNCTAD While recognizing that a well-designed regulatory framework that comprehensively addresses the legal, regulatory and institutional aspects is a key determinant of investment in the clean energy transition (figure 2), this Investment Policy Monitor focuses on some of the main incentives and disincentives to clean energy investment. It expands on the findings and analysis presented in the World Investment Report 2023: Investing in sustainable energy for all (WIR23) and further draws from the insights and the discussion at the WIF. First, it reviews and analyses renewable energy policies around the world and identifies the key policy tools utilized by countries in different regions and at different levels of development to promote investment in renewables (section 1). Second, it provides an overview of existing clean energy transition policies in technologies and fuels that would allow the decarbonization of the traditional power sector (section 2). Third, it highlights trends in the evolution of fossil fuel subsidies around the world, which represent a disincentive to the promotion of investment in clean electricity generation (section 3). Finally, it highlights the main findings and policy implications (section 4). 4 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 2: Key policy determinants of investment in the clean energy sector Source: UNCTAD 1. Renewable energy policies – a review of key investment incentives a. The universe of renewable energy policies Although the cost of renewable energy (especially wind and solar) has fallen substantially in the last decade, increasing its competitiveness in comparison to fossil fuel generation technologies (IRENA, 2022), risks and barriers to renewable energy investment remain, which hamper their development, especially in emerging and developing economies (box 2). Power generation technologies based on renewable energy typically require higher upfront investment than those based on fossil fuel. The cost of capital thus represents a higher importance in the investment decision. Given the intrinsic connection between the cost of capital and risks, this cost varies between countries and tends to be higher in emerging and developing economies. De-risking investment in renewables allows the cost of capital to decrease and thus enables renewable energy projects to better compete financially with fossil fuel generation technologies, especially in emerging and developing countries, where the cost of capital is higher (Polzin et al., 2021; Bachner, Mayer and Steininger, 2019). In this context, policies and regulatory frameworks can lower investment risks, promote the deployment of renewable energy generation technologies and help better correlate renewable energy potential with private investment. 5 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M The universe of renewable energy policies is complex, as countries adopt various laws, policies, and regulations depending on their legal and regulatory systems.1 Based on the review of 798 renewable energy policies, covering 192 economies, this section analyses investment promotion instruments and incentives used around the world to foster private investment in renewable energy sectors. Two-thirds of the countries around the world have enacted policies and laws specifically dedicated to renewable energy, but all countries have at least incorporated some aspects of renewable energy regulations or promotion into energy laws, energy and climate change strategies, electricity acts, or national development plans. In contrast, only 33 per cent of SIDS and 54 per cent of LDCs have laws specifically addressing renewable energy. Policies on renewable energy typically focus on three main policy aspects: regulation, private investment promotion, and public investment measures (figure 3). Figure 3: Policy aspects addressed in renewable energy policies, by type and category of countries (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Regulation encompasses a wide range of policies, including licensing and permitting systems, land access, industry structure, and renewable energy-specific aspects like priority access to the grid (figure 2). They also include general policies and strategies aimed at achieving emission reduction targets or promoting access to energy that align with climate goals or the energy-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). Such policies provide long-term vision and certainty, which are crucial for attracting investment. Private investment promotion policies include all types of incentives and risk reduction mechanisms aiming to attract investment to the sector. They will be further analyzed below. Public investment measures include direct investment by the State in generation capacities, through public enterprises and PPPs, as well as direct investment in research and development (R&D) in the sector. The use of these three policy aspects varies across country groups. While two thirds of developed economies prioritize improving the regulatory framework and promoting private investment in their renewable energy policies, only 24 per cent of LDCs and 25 per cent of SIDS do the same. Similarly, private investment promotion is a policy focus for over 75 per cent of developed countries, but only less than 30 per cent of LDCs and SIDS (figure 3). About a third of developed and developing economies emphasize on the role of public investment but only 22 per cent of LDCs and SIDS do the same. 1 See for instance, the “G20 Compendium on promoting investment for sustainable development”, prepared by UNCTAD under the guidance of the Indonesian Presidency of the G20, and with inputs from all G20 members and some associated countries, September 2022. https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/publications/1272/g20-compendium-on-promoting-investment-for-sustainable-development 6 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 2: Risks and barriers to investing in renewable energy generation In addition to the risks and barriers affecting all investment, such as macro-economic and political instability, renewable energy investment faces a range of specific risks and challenges. These include: Policy uncertainty The policy stability and the longer-term perspective are shown to be of particular importance in investment decisions (Criscuolo and Menon, 2015; Hafner, James and Jones, 2019), as the capital intensity of renewables usually implies a longer payback period and thus a higher need for policy stability to ensure positive return on investment. In Germany, for example, while Feed-in tariffs and other incentives to the sector have been crucial (Gawel, Strunz and Lehmann, 2016), their effectiveness has consistently decreased when policy uncertainty has increased (Agnolucci, 2006). Sector regulations Regulatory aspects of the renewable energy sector such as access to the grid are a critical determinant of FDI in the sector (Keeley and Ikeda, 2017; Mahbud et al., 2022; Ragosa and Warren, 2019). The energy market structures, regulations and governance, including the dispute resolution mechanisms, need to be clearly set to not be perceived as a risk for investors (e.g. vertical integration, the efficiency of licensing and permitting procedures; effectiveness of governing bodies, rule of law etc.). Moreover, regulations that favour fossil fuel industries are still in place in many countries which undermines the comparative advantage of renewable energy technologies (section 3). Electricity infrastructure Solar and wind represent a large share of the newly installed capacity today, but they are intermittent, depending on weather conditions. The integration of intermittent and more decentralized sources of energy requires higher flexibility of the grid and investment in storage systems. Grid flexibility depends on several factors, such as the balancing systems, generation capacities, storage options, and grid intelligence (smart grid). Moreover, the transmission and distribution networks are crucial for grid flexibility because a larger network makes it easier to transport energy from areas with excess capacity to areas with higher demand. Thus, the integration of renewable energy capacities depends on the investment made in transmission and distribution networks. Technology Renewable energy technologies have been available for some time, but their large-scale adoption is still relatively new, and there may be concerns about their long-term performance and reliability. Furthermore, the profitability of a renewable energy project is highly dependent on the location of the power plant, as it relies on the availability of wind and solar resources, but obtaining accurate and sufficient data on these critical geographic and climate factors can be challenging. Finally, a lack of in-country expertise for the construction and operation of renewable energy power plants can also pose challenges that may ultimately impact the project\\'s profitability. Financing One of the main obstacles to investment in renewable energy is accessing affordable finance. The high upfront costs associated with renewable energy technologies require long-term financing, but the cost of capital can quickly escalate in countries perceived as riskier, which can pose a significant burden, particularly for developing economies (IEA, 2021a). In this context, the availability of international public finance is a critical determinant of FDI in renewable energy in developing countries (Ragosa and Warren, 2019; Haščič et al., 2015). Additionally, a lack of knowledge and awareness of renewable energy technologies among potential sponsors and investors is another significant barrier that needs to be addressed.

Policy tools for the promotion of renewable energy investment Based on the review and mapping of 212 laws and policies2, covering 94 developing and developed economies (49 and 51 per cent respectively), this section analyses the investment promotion instruments and incentives used around the world to foster private investment in renewable energy. Countries have adopted various types of incentives (table 1). Among these, tax incentives are the instrument most often used for promoting renewable energy investment in developing countries (77 per cent), LDCs (90 per cent) and SIDS (67 per cent). In contrast, developed countries favour more targeted and complex policy instruments, with FITs, auctions and financial incentives adopted by 91 per cent, 74 per cent and 70 per cent respectively (figure 4).

Note: The graph covers laws adopted during the period 2000–2022, as well as amendments of some laws that were adopted before 2000. Feed-in tariff and auction data is based on other sources, covering 193 countries. \\\\\"Other\\\\\" includes quota-based instruments, guarantee schemes and business facilitation. 2 These are based on the review of 798 renewable energy policies and laws, covering 192 economies. These 212 laws and policies were selected because they include at least one type of investment promotion tool as defined in Table 1. 8 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Table 1 Investment promotion instruments for the renewable energy sector Fiscal incentives Profit-based Reduction of the standard corporate income tax rate or profit tax rate, tax holiday, loss carry forward Expenditure-based Accelerated depreciation, investment and reinvestment allowances, R&D tax incentives, tax credits Indirect taxes and duties Exemption or reduction of VAT on capital material, exemption on import taxes and duties Production-based Production-based tax credits Financial incentives Grants and subsidies Direct subsidies to cover (part of) capital, production or marketing costs Loans Subsidized loans Other tools Auctions Stimulate investment through government calls for tenders to install a certain capacity of renewable energy-sourced electricity, with the best bidder typically winning a long-term power purchase power agreement that guarantees sales and prices and the auctions structured as packages that include additional incentives such as access to land or low-cost grid connections Feed-in tariffs Incentivize the deployment of renewable energy by offering long-term contracts to producers with a guaranteed above-market price tariff, in a triple guarantee – certainty of sale, price and duration – that reduces project risk and encourages investment Renewable portfolio standards or quotas, and renewable energy certificates Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or quotas: define the share of renewable energy that must be present in the electricity mix of targeted entities, typically utility suppliers, companies or consumers Renewable energy certificates: represent the environmental benefits of one MWh of renewable energy generation, which can be bought and sold separately from the electricity itself Usually introduced together Other guarantee schemes Financial guarantees, including guarantees covering geological risks or other non-financial elements Business facilitation A range of measures aimed at facilitating the implementation of and investment in renewable energy companies, which may include dedicated single windows, facilitated access to land and simplified permitting and licensing, as well as access to information related to the renewable energy potential and needs of the country Source: UNCTAD 9 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M i. Tax incentives Tax incentives are well-established and well-known tools used by countries around the world to promote investment. The literature on their pros and cons is extensive. UNCTAD recently carried out a detailed mapping of their use across the globe (WIR22). Tax incentives can be customized to achieve certain policy objectives, and although they require governments to forgo tax revenue that could be used for other purposes, they do not typically require direct public spending. However, tax incentives may not directly address the main barriers to investment in renewable energy such as access to finance, market and infrastructure risks, and high upfront capital (box 1). Nonetheless, tax incentives are a common policy tool for promoting renewable energy investment, particularly in developing economies and LDCs (figure 5). Profit-based tax incentives such as corporate income tax reductions and tax holidays are particularly popular among developing countries (57 per cent of countries) and LDCs (70 per cent). The reduction or exemption of VAT and import duties is also very common in developing countries, as they often import most of the required capital goods and inputs. This instrument is used by 64 per cent of developing countries and 70 per cent of LDCs. In contrast, developed countries tend to favour the use of expenditure-based incentives and production-based tax credits. These findings are consistent with the broader analysis on the use of tax incentives for investment in developed and developing countries carried out by UNCTAD in the World Investment Report 2022. Figure 5: Tax incentives in renewable energy policies, by type and country group (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Note: The graph covers laws adopted during the period 2000–2022, but it also includes amendments of laws that were adopted before 2000. ii. Non-fiscal incentives Non-fiscal incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy include traditional policy instruments already used in the promotion of investment in other sectors, such as financial incentives (e.g. loans at preferred rates and traditional grants and subsidies), risk reduction mechanisms (e.g. guarantee schemes) and business facilitation measures. In addition, the unique specificities of the low-carbon transition have led to the development of more targeted, more complex policy instruments designed specifically to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy technologies. These new investment promotion tools include tariff-based instruments, auctions and quota-based instruments (discussed later). 10 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Grants and subsidies are the most common investment promotion instrument among traditional investment incentives. They can partially address the issue of high upfront cost associated with renewable energy projects. They are particularly favoured by developed countries. They are mentioned in the majority of the renewable energy policies that include investment promotion provisions in LDCs (figure 6). Loans, however, are not commonly used in investment promotion policies for renewable energy. In fact, only 16 per cent of developing countries and 13 per cent of developed countries use them. Figure 6: Non-fiscal incentives in renewable energy policies, by type and country group (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD, based on Climate Change Laws of the World database. Note: The graph covers laws adopted during the period 2000–2022, and amendments of laws that were adopted before 2000. Guarantee schemes include financial guarantee schemes and other “in kind” type of guarantees, such as priority access to the grid, or industrial guarantees on the availability of network or spare parts for the renewable energy sector. Due to the intermittency of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, priority access to the grid, in particular, is a key element to foster investment in the deployment of such technologies. Guarantee schemes are popular among developed countries (60 per cent of them have adopted at least one such scheme), but less utilized in developing countries (32 per cent) and LDCs (40 per cent). Business facilitation of renewable energy projects encompasses measures such as simplifying registration and licensing processes, providing easier access to land, and streamlining town planning authorizations. In addition to these measures, business facilitation may also involve the creation of specific tools to support renewable energy projects such as national-level solar, wind, or geothermal resource maps. Business facilitation instruments are employed in developed (45 per cent) and developing countries (34 per cent), but their use is slightly less prevalent in LDCs, where only 30 per cent of LDCs included them in their promotion policies for renewable energy (see figure 6). FITs were the first targeted incentive developed specifically to promote investment in renewable energy (see box 3). They offer guaranteed payments and have a longer-term perspective, which significantly reduces uncertainty about the return on renewable energy investments. They have led to the establishment of hundreds of MWh from renewable sources across the world. Policymakers have reformed FITs over the years to make them more efficient and more responsive to technology changes and market prices, and to decrease their impact on public finance. While the success of these instruments varies from country to country and on policy design (see policy examples in box 4), they have been widely implemented (in at least 106 countries) as a means of promoting adoption of renewable energy. 11 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 3: Feed-in tariffs Feed-in tariffs (FITs) are a mechanism implemented by governments to incentivize the deployment of renewable energy. They rely on a promise: they ensure renewable energy producers that their electricity will be bought at a predefined price over long periods. This triple guarantee — certainty of sale, price and duration — reduces project risk and encourages project developers. To give an example, a government will commit to buy all wind power produced in its country for $0,15/kWh over a period of twenty years. To define an optimal FIT scheme, policy makers need to take different elements into account: 1) Finding the right tariff level is a crucial step. If it is too low, the financial incentives will not convince project developers to invest. If it is too high, society will have to bear an unnecessary cost. The optimal price is usually based on an estimation including investment costs, grid connection costs, operation and maintenance costs, interest rates for the invested capital and profit margins for the investors. The tariff level is often degressive, meaning that it will decline each year according to a fixed percentage. This allows to take into account the expected decreasing costs of technology and to make sure that companies do not delay their investments (Alizamir, de Véricourt and Sun, 2016). In some cases, the subsidy consists of a payment rewarding the production of renewable energy which is added to the electricity market price: this system is known as feed-in premiums. The latter offer less certainty than classic FITs, given the fluctuation of the electricity market. 2) Efficient FITs are technology-specific. This helps targeting the type of renewable energy which should be developed, but also integrating the variations in terms of costs implied by each technology. 3) Determining who bares the extra cost of feed-in tariffs can impact the policy’s outcome. The national context plays an important role here. The possibility of charging the extra cost directly to users in developing countries, for example, is rather limited. 4) The contract duration is a key factor for profitability. FIT schemes can run from five to twenty years, though the majority last over fifteen years. 5) Reducing the administrative burden, like facilitating the delivery of permits and authorizations, helps improving the results of FITs. After having dominated renewable energy policies in the 2000s, FITs were criticized for their high cost and the lack of control over the quantity of renewable electricity produced they imply. Nonetheless, some developing countries are still adopting them with success. Between 2012 and 2017, for instance, the Philippines multiplied its solar, biomass and wind energy capacity by eight thanks to feed-in tariffs (Guild, 2019) (see box 3). Source: UNCTAD FITs have been particularly popular among developed countries, featuring in over 90 per cent of them. Yet, tariff-based instruments do not address the challenge of the high upfront costs associated with renewable energy projects and, depending on their features, can be relatively expensive for countries that have limited fiscal space, which explains why developing countries use FITs less frequently. Less than 50 per cent of developing countries, only 26 per cent of LDCs and only 22 per cent of SIDS have put FITs in place (figure 7). Indeed, smaller countries have often focussed instead on promoting the development of renewable energy production units at the household or small company level. SIDS, for instance tend to favour net-metering and net-billing schemes (box 5). 12 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 7: Use of feed-in tariffs, auctions and quota-based instruments, by country group, 2005–2022 (Per cent of countries) Source: UNCTAD Box 4: Feed-in tariffs: policy examples and key lessons In 2000, Germany introduced the Renewable Energy Act, a FIT policy offering all producers of renewable energy an above-market fixed price for a twenty-years period. The first beneficiaries of this program saw it ended in 2021. The impact on renewable energy production was important: between 2000 and 2021, the share of renewable energy in electricity consumption rose by 35 per cent (ZSW, 2022). But in the late 2000s, as the production costs of photovoltaic systems decreased, the policy started to appear particularly expensive. Germany decided to reform the Renewable Energy Act and, since 2017, only small facilities under 100 kW have kept on benefiting from the FIT, while large renewable energy producers are subject to auctions (Sutton, 2021). In 2009, South Africa established a renewable energy FIT scheme. Initially, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa developed a sector-specific project that ensured rates for 15 years, with tariffs that would decrease annually. To determine the project’s feasibility, public hearings were held with prospective investors, who indicated that the incentives were insufficient, resulting in an increase in the tariffs and a lengthening of the guaranteed period to 20 years. Despite these adjustments, the FIT scheme was never put into effect and was replaced by auctions after two years. According to critics, tariff rate uncertainty, bureaucratic delays, and conflicting messages from various government bodies resulted in an atmosphere of policy uncertainty that led to the scheme’s demise (Pegels, 2014). Despite a decreasing interest for FITs in the 2010s, several countries continued using them. The Philippines, for instance, adopted FITs in 2012 with impressive results. Five years after the start of the programme, the country’s capacity in solar, biomass and wind energy had been multiplied by eight. This success shows that policy design and implementation are as crucial as rates. Indeed, project developers give a lot of importance to factors such as administrative processing times, grid access and legal security (Lüthi and Prässler, 2011; Lüthi and Wüstenhagen, 2012). The Government of the Philippines followed a list of best practices, by adopting a long-term framework and associating feed-in tariffs with financial incentives. The extra cost implied by FITs was put on the consumers (Guild, 2019). Source: UNCTAD 13 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 5: Net-metering and net-billing in small island developing States For the last ten years, SIDS have privileged net-metering and net-billing instead of feed-in tariffs to promote renewable energy production. At least 44 per cent of them have adopted these schemes, and up to 62 per cent for SIDS located in the Caribbean region (Kersey, Blechinger and Shirley, 2021; REN21, 2021). These policies seek to incentivize citizens to adopt their own units of renewable energy production, by providing guarantees. With net-metering, households upload their electricity surplus into the grid, and when they do not produce enough electricity, they are able to take some from the grid. In other words, the grid is used as a free energy storage. At the end of the year, the power utilities check the balance. If the household has produced more than it has consumed, the balance is paid at the retail electricity tariff. If the household has consumed more than it has produced, it has to pay the difference. With net-billing, households with electric capacity production are also connected to the grid, but the electricity price change according to the demand. When the electric utilities face a high demand, they are ready to buy households’ production at a higher price than when the demand is low. This system gives households the incentive to produce a surplus when the global demand is high, and to consume when the demand is low (IRENA, 2019b). By targeting households and promoting the development of small-scale renewable energy production, net-metering and net-billing are particularly adapted to SIDS’ unique characteristics. Source: UNCTAD Another policy tool designed specifically to foster investment in the deployment of renewable energy is the renewable energy auction (see table 1). Since the 2010s, auctions have boomed in popularity because they are both cost-efficient and adaptable to different economic contexts. They are used in all continents, independently of countries’ development levels, and have helped to lower renewable energy prices. The purchase power agreement and other non-financial incentives resulting from the auctions offer a long-term guarantee on price and sales that incentivizes investors to participate. For policymakers, however, the complexity of auctions lies in their design and organization, which are crucial to their success. The design should include factors such as the auctioned volume, qualification requirements for bidders, auction format and site selection. These factors will depend on a government’s policy goals and on country characteristics. It is not uncommon for countries to require multiple auction rounds to achieve an optimal design, as policymakers must bypass several pitfalls when designing an auction, such as undersubscription, underbidding, delays and underbuilding (see policy examples in box 6). Auctions have become the main mechanism for increasing renewable energy capacity worldwide, with at least 125 countries holding auctions over the last decade. Three quarters of developed countries and two thirds of developing countries have held renewable energy auctions; the shares are lower for LDCs (52 per cent) and SIDS (33 per cent) (see figure 7). The complexity of designing and holding auctions may explain the lower prevalence in these countries. A third policy instrument specifically designed to foster investment in renewable energy is the combined use of quotas, also referred to as renewable portfolio standards or renewable purchase obligations, and renewable energy certificates, which are mechanisms to certify the origin of the renewable energy (see box 7). Companies can then sell these certificates, which should, in theory, provide a bonus in revenue to renewable energy producers. Renewable portfolio standards policies are typically complex to administer. Although they are used by one third of developed countries, their adoption has been more limited in developing countries (21 per cent), LDCs (7 per cent) and SIDS (3 per cent) (see figure 7). 14 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 6: Examples of renewable energy auctions in SIDS and LDCs Maldives has held several auctions between 2014 and 2022, managing to convince project developers over time. In 2014, an auction aiming to create 1.5 MW of solar capacity attracted only four bidders, resulting in high electricity prices. Six years later, an auction for a 5 MW project attracted 25 project developers, leading to a drop in the price by 50 per cent. In 2022, an 11 MW solar project attracted 63 investors and resulted in one of the lowest tariffs ever achieved in SIDS. Investors have been convinced by the risk mitigation package supported by the World Bank, which includes guarantees, a currency convertibility clause and payment security (Chen, Jain and Stolp, 2023). Uganda launched its first solar photovoltaic auction in 2014, for a total capacity of four 5 MW facilities. Based on qualification requirements, 7 of the 23 companies that expressed interest were allowed to submit bids. Site selection was left to project developers, with the condition that the power stations would be within 3 km of the grid. Moreover, if the project was located in a set of predefined priority zones, the application would be granted more points in the evaluation. Different penalties were defined for cases of delays and underperformance. This sealed-bid auction was supported by international development partners, which committed to paying part of the electricity price. Consequently, the four winners of the auction had two contracts: a power purchase agreement of 20 years in dollars with the State-owned utility company and a premium payment contract in euros signed with the German Development Bank. Uganda also benefited from European Union support, from the development of standardized documents to the payment of the tender agent that conducting the auction (IRENA, 2018). The winning bid was $163.7/MWh – lower than the average retail tariff in 2013, but more than double the results achieved in Ethiopia, Namibia, South Africa or Zambia (Kruger, Eberhard and Swartz, 2018). Zambia was the first African country to take part in the Scaling Solar Programme, which includes multiple guarantees and technical support. Led by the World Bank, this programme aims to develop large solar power plants through auctions. In 2015, the country signed off on two projects representing a total capacity of 88 MW generated through solar photovoltaic power (IRENA, 2019). The Scaling Solar Program has benefited other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Ethiopia, Madagascar and Senegal. In 2019, Zambia awarded 120 MW of capacity for a solar photovoltaic project. This tender achieved a low-price record for Sub-Saharan Africa. It is worth noting that the auction did not define the location of the operating site, nor did it finance the connection to the grid (Parnell, 2019). Source: UNCTAD Box 7: Quotas and renewable energy certificates (RECs): key policy aspects Some governments have adopted a system of quotas and certificates to control the quantity of renewable energy produced. Accordingly, authorities set goals in terms of renewable electricity and the involved entities develop strategies to meet them, either by producing renewable energy themselves or by delegating this task. A system of tradable certificates, commonly known as renewable energy certificates, helps companies or electricity suppliers proving that they respect quotas. Knowing that there is a demand, companies specialized in renewable energy production are incentivized to develop new capacity. For each MWh of renewable energy produced and delivered to the grid, they will receive a certificate, which can be sold. They usually have two sources of revenue: the sale of electricity itself at market price and the sale of the certificates. The difference between the two covers the extra costs implied by renewable energy production and allows profits. This system follows a market mechanism. The prices of electricity and of certificates fluctuate, meaning that actors have less certainty. If there is too much offer, the certificates will see their prices decrease, leading inefficient producers to cease their activity. If there is too little offer, the certificates will see their prices increase, inviting renewable energy producers to invest. In this picture, governments usually play the role of regulators. They try to develop the best system of certificates by playing on different factors: 1) The non-respect of the quotas usually involves penalties. It is the fear of having to pay these fines which motivates the purchase of certificates. The latter are logically less expensive than penalties. The design of penalties plays an important role on the policy’s efficiency. 15 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 2) The organisation of the certificates system is key. Policymakers need to ensure that certificates are traceable and forgery-proof. To avoid double counting, certificates can usually only be sold once. They also have a fixed validity period, commonly one year, ensuring that the system remains dynamic. The optimal policy facilitates both the production and the trading of these certificates. Since their creation, quotas have been introduced in at least 41 countries, often in combination with a renewable energy certificate system. While they have been popular in developed economies, developing ones have also adopted them. These include Bolivia, China, Ghana, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Senegal, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates, among others. RECs do not necessarily come with obligations. The European Union, for example, launched in 2001 the Guarantees of Origin certificates. Their purchase is entirely voluntary and, nonetheless, they have been widely sold. Thanks to them, private companies can prove their efforts in achieving clean energy goals. Similarly, citizens buy these certificates to show their commitment to the energy transition. RECs are still attracting policymakers’ attention. To support its efforts to reach a share of 35 per cent of clean energy in its electricity mix by 2024, Mexico adopted in 2018 a combined system of quotas and market of certificates: Certificados de Energías Limpias (CEL). CEL must be bought by large electricity consumers and electricity suppliers to prove that they respect the imposed quotas. From a 5 per cent quota of clean electricity set for 2018, the share gradually increases up to 13.9 per cent in 2022. The Energy Regulatory Commission verifies the compliance of obliged entities and may impose fines. In this programme, the accepted energy is not limited to wind, solar, hydro, wave, geothermal and biomass power, but also include nuclear and efficient cogeneration. According to official data from Sener, 29 per cent of the electricity generated in 2022 in Mexico was from a clean source. Source: UNCTAD 16 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 2. Clean energy – new technologies and complex policies Besides the need for significant investments in renewable energy, a rapid transition to low-carbon energy also requires parallel investments for greening existing and future fossil fuel power plants. Indeed, despite the expansion of renewable energy, thermal generation remains the primary source of both electricity and heat worldwide (IEA, 2021b) and new thermal capacity is still being built around the world every year. Thermal power plants will still have useful technical lives, even in a time when countries should have already reduced their use of fossil fuels to comply with climate targets. In emerging economies, 83 per cent of these power plants are expected to remain technically useful in 2030, and 61 per cent in 2040, in light of recent investments (IEA, 2021b). In this context, while ultimately the objective is to phase out fossil fuels, it is important to include thermal power plants into the low-carbon transition and consider a mix of technologies to reach global energy and climate goals. To decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel plants, three main levers can be considered: increasing their efficiency, developing CCUS technologies, and using cofiring and low-carbon fuels (figure 8). Figure 8: Key aspects of the clean energy transition of the power sector Source: UNCTAD a. Increasing the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants Several technologies can increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power plants by reducing the amount of fuel required to generate a given amount of electricity, which can lower costs and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. One of them is combined heat and power (CHP) technologies. CHP technologies, also known as cogeneration, produce both electricity and heat. They capture the heat that is usually released into the environment in traditional power plants and use it for other purposes. CHP technologies are very efficient. For example, in the United States, the average efficiency of fossil-fueled power plants is 36 per cent. In comparison, CHP technologies can achieve energy efficiency levels of up to 90 per cent.3 3 These number comes from the US Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/chp/chp-benefits#:~:text=By%20recovering%20and%20 using%20heat,achieve%20efficiencies%20approaching%2090%20percent, accessed on 16 March 2023). EPA uses the “total system efficiency” to calculate CHP efficiency: the total electricity and useful thermal energy output of the system divided by the fuel used to produce the electricity and useful thermal energy. 17 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Despite the theoretical benefits and the maturity of CHP technologies, investment in their deployment is still limited. The first European Union Directive on the promotion of cogeneration has been adopted in 2004. However, the share of CHP in total electricity generation has been relatively stable since 2005 (11 per cent in 2005 and 12 per cent in 2019). 4 Indeed, although CHP technologies were encouraged in several European countries, promotion mechanisms often proved little effective, as the prices of certificates of origin were kept at relatively low levels (Stoltmann et al, 2019). Other barriers remain, such as the lack of district heating networks,5 access to the grid, especially for smaller projects, low demand for heat, and high upfront costs. The adoption of CHP technologies has been considerably slower in developing countries, except for larger countries like China and India (box 8). Box 8: Examples of policies to promote CHP technologies China\\'s 14th Five-Year Plan prioritized energy security and decarbonization in its energy strategy. Since the 2000s, cogeneration has been a significant aspect of China\\'s energy policy, and the country has a well-established district heating system. However, China\\'s district heating system still primarily relies on coal-based cogeneration power plants, which have caused significant environmental problems, particularly in terms of air quality. Consequently, China has focused its efforts on promoting efficient gas-based cogeneration power plants and developing nuclear-based cogeneration units. The country\\'s nuclear development policy emphasizes the development of small and micro nuclear units, which facilitate cogeneration and the use of nuclear energy for heating. In 2022, Haiyang became the first Chinese city to benefit from a nuclear-based district heating system (1). In 2004, the European Union issued a directive to promote cogeneration (2). This directive mandates member States to publish a cogeneration report every four years. In 2012, the European Union\\'s Energy Efficiency Directive was introduced, which requires member States to encourage the use of highly efficient cogeneration technologies and to conduct energy efficiency assessments of CHP systems. The directive also stipulates that European Union member States ensure the traceability of electricity generated from high-efficiency cogeneration through guarantees of origin (3). In 2017, Greece introduced feed-in premiums to combined heat and power plants through tenders. In 2020, Poland introduced financial incentives for high-efficiency power cogeneration, in the form of premiums paid to producers of electricity from cogeneration units. In the United States, the promotion of CHP technologies has been facilitated through a variety of policies and regulations at both the Federal and State levels. These policies include loans, grants, feed-in tariffs, production incentives, and tax incentives. Some States have also implemented CHP Portfolio Standards in the past decade, which require utilities to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from CHP systems. More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, provides a 30 per cent investment tax credit for CHP projects that begin construction before January 1, 2025.

Carbon capture, utilization and storage CCUS technologies involve capturing CO2 from large point sources, such as industrial or power generation facilities that use fossil fuels or biomass, or directly from the atmosphere. Once captured, the CO2 is compressed and transported by pipeline, rail, ship, or truck for various applications or injected into deep geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs or saline formations, for permanent storage. CCUS technologies can be retrofitted in existing fossil fuel power plants and can become critical to achieve global climate goals, while also ensuring universal energy access. CCUS technologies deployment is fairly recent, and to achieve net zero by 2050, investment in CCUS technologies needs to be scaled up. In 2022, according to the IEA, there were only around 35 commercial facilities applying CCUS to industrial processes, fuel transformation and power generation. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in momentum, with approximately 300 CCUS projects at various stages of development throughout the CCUS value chain. More than 200 new capture facilities are expected to become operational by 2030, capturing over 220 million tons of CO2 annually. Despite this fast progress, at current levels, CCUS deployment would still fall well short of what is required to achieve the net zero scenario (IEA, 2022a). In addition, it should be noted that CCUS is not yet mature technology and negative environmental impact can also arise from the use of CCUS in combination with traditional fuels. When CCUS technologies are added to a thermal power plant, more energy is needed to generate the same amount of electricity, which can lead to increased environmental damage throughout the value chain, such as methane leaks and other forms of environmental degradation (UNEP, 2016). Promoting the development and deployment of CCUS technologies requires a regulatory framework that addresses the entire value chain. This framework should include legal and regulatory measures to ensure safe and secure CO2 storage, protection of public health and the environment, and effective management of CCUS activities through the whole value chain (e.g. capture, transport, use and long-term storage). Laws and regulations must be put in place to clarify the rights and responsibilities of CCUS stakeholders, particularly in long-term storage resource management (IEA 2022b). Such policies will provide certainty to investors, build public confidence, and increase acceptance of this technology. While several countries have already developed comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks for CCUS, these efforts have largely been limited to developed economies (e.g. Australia, Canada, Norway, the United States, and the European Union), with some notable exceptions in developing countries (e.g. China, Singapore). So far, governments have adopted a mix of regulations (e.g. CO2 emission limitation, carbon pricing) and promotion instruments (e.g. R&D and investment incentives) to foster the deployment of CCUS (box 9). 19 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 9: Examples of policies to promote CCUS technologies In 2017, China established technology targets focused on achieving cost-effective large-scale CCUS, with its Special Program Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation to Address Climate Change, part of the 13th Five-Year Plan. It aimed to bolster the global competitiveness of China’s low-carbon industry and reach its emissions peak by 2030. In 2021, Australia launched a program worth AUD 250 million to deploy CCUS technologies at scale. The CCUS Hubs and Technologies program aims to enhance Australia’s CCUS capabilities by promoting collaborations between domestic and international researchers and reducing the cost of technology adoption. In 2021, Singapore created the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative, which aims to develop low-carbon energy technologies in hydrogen and CCUS, to support the decarbonization of the power and industry sectors. In 2021, Sweden announced subsidies to players investing in bio-CCS facilities, the process of capturing, separating and storing CO2 from renewable sources. The first reversed auction is planned for 2023. In 2022, Canada implemented an investment tax credit for CCUS, including direct air capture projects and equipment for transportation, storage and use. In 2022, the United Kingdom published the “Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (CCUS): Investor Roadmap”, which outlines key opportunities for investment in CCUS in the country. Additionally, the United Kingdom has implemented an R&D policy to foster innovation in the sector. The CCUS Innovation 2.0 program is a funding initiative worth £20 million aimed at reducing the expense of capturing and storing CO2 in the country. The programme intends to showcase and mitigate the risks of next-generation CCUS technologies, allowing for their commercial deployment from 2025. It also aims to decrease the cost of deploying CCUS and create competitive pressures on existing technologies. In 2022, the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act modified and extended to January 2033 the existing federal tax credit (named 45Q) that rewards companies for each ton of carbon dioxide that has been securely stored geologically in approved reservoirs and aquifers. Source: UNCTAD based on IEA/IRENA Global Renewable Energy Policies and Measures Database c. Cofiring low-carbon fuels Co-firing techniques, which involve mixing a low-carbon fuel (such as sustainable biomass and waste, low-carbon hydrogen, or low carbon ammonia) with the fossil fuel in a power plant, have made significant progress in recent years. 6 The transition of fossil fuel power plants to low-carbon fuels combustion and cofiring can therefore be an important tool for decarbonizing the power sector while utilizing existing assets and their related infrastructure. To achieve decarbonization at larger scale, however, the price and the GHG emission of these low-carbon fuels must decrease further and for that, investment in low carbon fuels need to increase further. Indeed, while hydrogen is always low carbon in its usage, it is not always low carbon in its production (box 10). In order to promote investment in green hydrogen, a country needs to promote the development of both the necessary infrastructure for producing, storing and transporting hydrogen, as well as the production facilities themselves. The adoption of a dedicated strategy can be a tool to address these inter-related aspects. Since Japan introduced the first national hydrogen strategy in 2017, 45 countries around the world have implemented a national hydrogen strategy or roadmap, as of February 2023 (figure 9), including 18 member States of the European Union, 9 Latin American and Caribbean countries, 4 African countries, and 9 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 6 Co-firing of up to 20 per cent of ammonia and over 90 per cent of hydrogen has been achieved at small power plants. Low-carbon ammonia (NH3) is produced by using hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis and nitrogen separated from the air. These are then fed into the Haber process (also known as Haber-Bosch). The ammonia is green when it is produced with low-carbon hydrogen and the Haber process powered by sustainable energy. 20 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Box 10: The “colours” of hydrogen Green hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources through a process called electrolysis, which involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an electric current. Since the electricity used to trigger the chemical reaction comes from renewable sources, green hydrogen is considered a clean fuel with no emissions during the production process. Black or brown hydrogen is produced using black coal or lignite (brown coal). The gasification of coal, the method used to produce black hydrogen, is a very polluting process, as both CO2 and carbon monoxide are produced as by-products and released into the atmosphere. It is the most environmentally harmful type of hydrogen. Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, usually natural gas, through a process called steam methane reforming. The term “grey” refers to the fact that this process produces large amounts of carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere. Blue hydrogen is produced using the same process as grey hydrogen, but with the addition of CCUS technology to capture the carbon dioxide emissions and store them underground. While blue hydrogen is sometimes considered as an important transitional fuel that can help reduce emissions, greenhouse gas emissions from the production of blue hydrogen are far from insignificant, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane, a powerful GHG. Purple hydrogen is produced from nuclear energy sources through a process called high-temperature electrolysis. Pink hydrogen is produced through the same electrolysis processes as green hydrogen, but the electricity used in the process comes from nuclear power plants. White hydrogen is the naturally occurring hydrogen in underground deposits. Identified deposits are still very limited and there is no strategy to exploit them at present.

Fossil fuel subsidies: a disincentive to clean energy investment Countries adopt fossil fuel subsidies for a variety of reasons, including job creation, economic growth, energy security, consumer benefits, and political and strategic interests. By artificially lowering the cost of producing and consuming fossil fuels, subsidies make such fuels more appealing to consumers and investors. This, in turn, makes it more challenging for renewable energy sources to compete to attract investment, particularly when they do not receive the same level of support. Fossil fuel subsidies also create an incumbent advantage, reinforcing the position of fossil fuels in the electricity system (IISD, 2014). While recognizing the economic, social and political complexity of such reform, phasing out these subsidies can help increase investment in renewable energy. In recent years, fossil fuel subsidies represented on average about half a per cent of world GDP, and up to 1 per cent of GDP in developing countries (for some countries, up to 7 per cent of GDP)7. Phasing them out and redirecting those funds to support renewable energy can therefore make clean energy a more viable option. Finally, reducing these subsidies can also send a clear signal to the market that governments are committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy and to attracting investment in the renewable energy sector. Despite reiterated commitments on major international forums to discontinue these inefficient subsidies (box 11), the global level of support in 2021 remained similar to that of 2010, totalling over $500 billion.8 In 2022, according to IEA estimates, global fossil fuel subsidies doubled from the previous year to an all-time high of $1 trillion (IEA, 2023). This is almost eight times the amount of global subsidies granted to renewable power generation technologies in 2017, as estimated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (Taylor, 2020). Box 11: Key international commitments on fossil fuel subsidies reduction United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): In 2015, the United Nations included fossil fuel subsidy reform as part of its sustainable development agenda. SDG 12.c calls for countries to \\\\\"rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption\\\\\". Paris Agreement: The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, includes a commitment to \\\\\"making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\\\\\" This commitment includes the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies. The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh reiterated a commitment made at the COP26 held in Glasgow in 2021, where a number of countries and organizations agreed to reduce fossil fuel subsidies. The Glasgow Leaders\\' Declaration on Clean Energy Transitions, signed by over 100 countries, includes a commitment to \\\\\"accelerate action to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and increase emissions.\\\\\" The declaration also calls for increased funding for the clean energy transition in developing countries. In addition, the G7 and G20 have made several statements regarding the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies. Among them, in 2015, G7 leaders committed to \\\\\"phase out and rationalize over the medium-term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption”. In 2009, G20 leaders reiterated that commitment, “recognizing the need to support the poor”, and in 2019, G20 leaders acknowledged \\\\\"the need for transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and the importance of phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\\\\\" Source: UNCTAD. 7 UNCTAD computations based on data from FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org 8 According to the IMF, this figure rises to almost $6 trillion (or 6.8 per cent of world GDP), if the hidden costs of fossil fuels, including their impact on air pollution and global warming are taken into account (IMF, 2021). 22 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Data on fossil fuel subsidies at the global level show that they are closely tied to the evolution of oil prices, rather than to deliberate policy decisions aimed at their reduction. The correlation is particularly strong for oil, electricity and gas subsidies, but less so for coal subsidies, which have remained stable throughout the period, hovering around $20 billion per year (see figure 10). Figure 10: Global fossil fuel subsidies by type and the price of oil, 2010–2022 (Billions of dollars and dollars per barrel) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Note: *Estimate from IEA (2023) Global trends mask the differences in the evolution of subsidies offered by developed and developing regions, and by type of fuel (figure 11). On average, developing countries account for over three quarters of world subsidies on oil, gas and electricity for end-user consumption of fossil fuel origin. However, while subsidies on oil have decreased significantly in developing countries, they have increased steadily in developed countries, almost doubling in volume between 2010 and 2021. Conversely, coal subsidies have declined steadily over the past decade in developed regions, dropping from $18.5 billion in 2010 to $9.8 billion in 2021, but more than doubled in developing regions, increasing from $5.6 billion in 2010 to $13.3 billion in 2021. The data for 2022 is not yet complete, but there is a likelihood that subsidies on gas in developed countries saw a substantial increase to offset the rise in prices during that year. 23 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 11: Fossil fuel subsidies in developed and developing economies, by type and region 2010-2021 (Billions of dollars) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Data collected by the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker initiative indicates that such subsidies also increasingly benefit producers rather than consumers. Although consumers remain the key beneficiaries of fossil fuels subsidies, their share in total subsidies has declined by 10 per cent between 2010 and 2020, while the share of producer subsidies has doubled in the same period (from 7 to 14 per cent). The record share of producer subsidies in 2020 may be due to the sudden and unexpected fall in demand for energy brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred policymakers to consider financial assistance to fossil fuel companies in order to mitigate damage to the industry (Kotchen, 2021). The trend, however, started well before the pandemic, with alarming consequences on investment attractiveness. Again, global trends obscure significant differences between countries at different levels of development. Notably, in developing countries, consumer subsidies have decreased from 97 to 87 per cent of the total between 2010 and 2020, while producer subsidies have increased from 3 to 10 per cent in the same period. Conversely, in developed countries, consumer subsidies have slightly increased their share of total fossil fuel subsidies from 2010 to 2020 (from 64 to 68 per cent), while producer subsidies have remained stable at around 25 per cent (figure 12). 24 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M Figure 12: Fossil fuel subsidies by beneficiary in developed and developing countries, 2010 and 2020 (Per cent) Source: UNCTAD, based on FossilFuelSubsidytracker.org Although there is universal agreement on the need to reduce or remove fossil fuel subsidies, it remains a complex policy issue, particularly in developing countries, which must overcome multiple competing interests and challenges: • Dependence on fossil fuels: Many developing countries rely heavily on fossil fuels, both as a source of energy and as a revenue stream. Reducing or removing subsidies could result in a gap in energy supply as well as higher energy costs and a loss of export revenue, which may be difficult for governments to manage. • Energy for all: Although studies show that fossil fuel subsidies are regressive by nature and benefit the wealthiest the most, subsidies can help make energy more affordable for low-income households. 9 Removing them could lead to an increase in energy poverty, which is a major concern for many developing countries. • Short-term economic impacts: The International Labour Organization estimates that the transition to net zero brings substantial new opportunities for employment, but the new jobs may be in different locations or require different skill sets, thus calling for policies to minimize hardship and promote skills upgrading. Reducing or removing subsidies may also result in short-term economic impacts, such as job losses in the fossil fuel industry and higher energy costs for consumers and businesses. These impacts may be difficult for governments to manage and may lead to resistance to change. • Political interests: The removal of subsidies may face opposition from large corporations, which may have significant political influence, as well as a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Nonetheless, according to the IEA, achieving net zero by 2050 will require the elimination of all fossil fuel subsidies in the coming years (IEA, 2021c). Hence, governments must navigate these challenges carefully and develop a well-thought-out plan for phasing out subsidies in a manner that minimizes negative impacts, is inclusive and supports the transition to a low-carbon economy in a just and cost-effective manner (WIR23). 9 See, for instance, Moayed, Guggenheim and von Chamier (2021), or World Bank (2012). 25 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M 4. Conclusion UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2023 calls for urgent support to developing countries to enable them to attract significantly more investment for their transition to clean energy. UNCTAD\\'s 8th WIF, which came to a close on 20 October, also called on public and private investors to play a pivotal role in reshaping the world economy and advancing the energy transition. Recognizing that policies and regulations have a key role to play in de-risking as well as incentivizing investment in the clean energy sector, the Forum generated insights and policy proposals for further discussions at COP28. Investing in renewables and clean energy is hindered by a range of specific risks and challenges, leading to higher costs of capital, especially in emerging and developing countries. Factors such as the natural resources endowment, the quality of the regulatory environment, market size and maturity, and economic and political uncertainty determine the unique potential and risk profile of each country. While policymakers in all countries should ensure that the key policy determinants for the promotion of renewable and clean energy investment are addressed through a solid legal and regulatory framework, 10 the analysis in this Investment Policy Monitor has highlighted a number of additional policy lessons: 1. Developing countries and LDCs face specific challenges in the development and adoption of policies and strategies specific to renewable energy. When such policies exist, they typically lack a focus on the promotion of private investment. Similarly, in the case of clean energy technologies, efforts to develop comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks have largely been limited to developed and large emerging economies. 2. The policy tools employed to promote renewable energy (summarized in table 2) are often not suited to country- and industry-specific situations. Developing countries and LDCs tend to rely more on generic promotion instruments, such as profit-based tax incentives, because of familiarity with those tools, their lower level of complexity and the fact that they do not require upfront expenditure of public funds. However, these instruments can be expensive in the long run (in terms of forgone government revenues), and their effectiveness in the promotion of renewable energy investment is often low because they do not directly tackle the key challenges for investors in the sector. Advanced economies tend to use more complex and targeted mechanisms to promote investment in the renewables and energy infrastructure sectors (e.g. feed-in tariffs and auctions). The choice of the investment promotion instruments employed needs to take into account country, location as well as technology-specific criteria, including factors such as market size, regulatory capacities, and infrastructure gaps, which are critical for selecting the appropriate promotion tools for derisking investments and fostering their deployment. 3. Despite reiterated commitments to discontinue inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the global level of support has reached record levels, and increasingly benefits fossil fuel producers. These subsidies are detrimental to climate change mitigation in and by themselves, and they are also a factor holding back renewables investment in some countries. They affect the incentive for firms to invest in clean energy, and they weigh heavily on government resources to support energy transition investment. Reallocating resources currently devoted to supporting traditional fossil fuel technologies can facilitate the adoption of targeted policies and regulations for promoting clean energy. To address the above challenges and promote a balanced approach that considers all three objectives of the energy transition – meeting climate goals, providing affordable energy for all and ensuring energy security – the World Investment Report 2023 puts forward a Global Action Compact for Investment in Sustainable Energy for All. The compact recognizes the need to find an equilibrium in investment and energy policymaking between many 10 See, in this regard: “Promoting Sustainable Investment in Renewable Energy for Global Economic Recovery”, an Issues Paper jointly prepared by the Indonesian Presidency of the G20 and UNCTAD to facilitate the discussions at the 2nd G20 Trade, Investment and Industry Working Group Meeting, 6-7 July 2022, Solo, Indonesia. 26 ISSUE 26 NOVEMBER 2023 I P M alternative approaches and proposes six action packages covering national and international investment policymaking; global, regional and South–South partnerships and cooperation; financing mechanisms and tools, and sustainable finance markets.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Laurent Fabius, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France and President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21); and François Hollande, President of France celebrate after the historic adoption of Paris Agreement on climate change. \\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement\\\\n===================\\\\n\\\\nClimate change is a global emergency that goes beyond national borders. It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels.\\\\n\\\\nTo tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the [UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris](http://www.cop21paris.org/) reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf).\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:\\\\n\\\\n*   substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\\\\n*   periodically assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of this agreement and its long-term goals\\\\n*   provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts.\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, [195 Parties](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&clang=_en) (194 States plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement.\\\\n\\\\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries’ climate goals.\\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement provides a durable framework guiding the global effort for decades to come. It marks the beginning of a shift towards a [net-zero](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition) emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/17-goals-to-transform-our-world).\\\\n\\\\nHow does it work?\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nThe Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as [**Nationally Determined Contribution**](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs), or NDC.\\\\n\\\\nIn their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures.\\\\n\\\\n In 2023, the first **“[global stocktake](https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake)”** of the world’s efforts under the Paris Agreement concluded at **[COP28](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop28)** with a [decision](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_L17_adv.pdf) on how to accelerate action across all areas – mitigation, adaptation, and finance – by 2030, including a call on governments to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to [renewable energy](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy) such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments.\\\\n\\\\nTo better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit **long-term strategies**. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory.\\\\n\\\\nThe operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the [Paris Rulebook](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/katowice-climate-package), and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.\\\\n\\\\n_More information on the Paris Agreement can be found [here](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement)._\\\\n\\\\n![Image 3: Key elements of the Paris Agreement](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2020/12/key-elements_parisagreement.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### Key elements of the\\\\n\\\\n Paris Agreement\\\\n\\\\n*   To keep global temperatures well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times while pursuing means to limit the increase to 1.5C.\\\\n*   To review countries’ contribution to cutting emissions every five years\\\\n*   To help poorer nations by providing climate finance to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy\\\\n\\\\n### Aidan Gallagher: The Paris Agreement Works\\\\n\\\\n### What is the \\'Paris Agreement\\', and how does it work?\\\\n\\\\nRead more\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 4](https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/image011.png)](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition)\\\\n### [Net zero](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition)\\\\n\\\\nWhat is net zero?

But in a village in the UK, people are being offered a [20-50% discount on their household energy bills as part of an incentive scheme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64264643) that is helping to promote renewable energy projects.\\\\n\\\\nThe scheme sees [people who live near renewable power projects such as wind farms benefiting from price cuts](https://www.octopusenergygeneration.com/fan-club/).

Image: IRENA \\\\n\\\\nGermany\\\\n-------\\\\n\\\\nHouseholds in Germany that produce renewable energy at home can sell any excess to the national grid. The [feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/feed-in-tariff.asp) – which has been adopted by many other countries – pays renewable energy producers a set rate per kilowatt-hour for electricity they feed into the grid.\\\\n\\\\nGermany also provides homeowners with [tax incentives for energy-efficient renovations](https://www.iea.org/policies/11633-tax-deductions-for-building-renovations) – households can claim back 20% of renovation costs up to €40,000 ($44,000) if they replace inefficient doors or windows, or buy new heating systems and insulation.\\\\n\\\\nUS\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) arrived later than many other renewable energy initiatives, but it is so large in scope that it transformed the nation to a global leader in decarbonization investment potential almost overnight.\\\\n\\\\nNearly [$400 billion in federal funding](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) is available across a wide range of sectors, mainly in the form of tax credits. A lot of the incentives are there to help the private sector invest in large-scale projects, like producing clean hydrogen or nuclear facilities. But some are there to help households decarbonize and benefit from the typically lower unit costs of renewables.\\\\n\\\\n0 seconds of 0 seconds Volume 90%\\\\n\\\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\\\n\\\\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\\\\n\\\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\\\n\\\\nPlay/Pause SPACE\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Volume↑\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Volume↓\\\\n\\\\nSeek Forward→\\\\n\\\\nSeek Backward←\\\\n\\\\nCaptions On/Off c\\\\n\\\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\\\\n\\\\nMute/Unmute m\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Caption Size-\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\\\\n\\\\nSeek %0-9\\\\n\\\\n0.5x 1x 1.25x 1.5x 2x\\\\n\\\\nLive\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\nUS citizens can get $2,000 per year in credits for installing a heat pump, and up to $7,500 in credits for a new electric vehicle.\\\\n\\\\nIndia\\\\n-----\\\\n\\\\nIndia is aiming for [65% of its power generation to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/india-to-have-over-65-power-generation-capacity-from-non-fossil-fuels-by-2030-rk-singh/articleshow/94910750.cms).\\\\n\\\\nThe right incentives can catapult renewable energy growth – a [solar power initiative in Gujarat](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/india-solar-power-gujarat/) has been so successful that the state accounts for around two-thirds of all residential rooftop solar power in the country, despite covering just 6% of India’s land mass.\\\\n\\\\n0 seconds of 0 seconds Volume 90%\\\\n\\\\nPress shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcuts\\\\n\\\\nKeyboard Shortcuts Enabled Disabled\\\\n\\\\nShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?\\\\n\\\\nPlay/Pause SPACE\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Volume↑\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Volume↓\\\\n\\\\nSeek Forward→\\\\n\\\\nSeek Backward←\\\\n\\\\nCaptions On/Off c\\\\n\\\\nFullscreen/Exit Fullscreen f\\\\n\\\\nMute/Unmute m\\\\n\\\\nDecrease Caption Size-\\\\n\\\\nIncrease Caption Size+ or =\\\\n\\\\nSeek %0-9\\\\n\\\\n0.5x 1x 1.25x 1.5x 2x\\\\n\\\\nAuto 960p 640p 480p 320p\\\\n\\\\nLive\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\n00:00\\\\n\\\\nAustralia\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\n[Australia wants more than 80% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030](https://www.iea.org/news/australia-has-raised-its-climate-targets-and-now-needs-to-accelerate-its-clean-energy-transition-says-new-iea-review), and it is providing help for households to offset the high upfront costs of some energy systems.\\\\n\\\\nHouseholds installing small-scale energy systems – be that solar, wind or hydro – or a hot water system can benefit from financial incentives under the [Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/How-the-scheme-works/Small-scale-Renewable-Energy-Scheme).\\\\n\\\\nDiscover\\\\nHow is the World Economic Forum facilitating the transition to clean energy?\\\\n\\\\nShow more\\\\n\\\\nThe [Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024 report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/fostering-effective-energy-transition-2023#report-nav) showed that after a decade of progress, the global energy transition has plateaued amid the global energy crisis and geopolitical volatilities.\\\\n\\\\nThe World Economic Forum’s [Centre for Energy and Materials](https://centres.weforum.org/centre-for-energy-and-materials/home) is driving the transition to a “fit for 2050” energy system.

Incentives and Disincentives\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n21 Nov 2023\\\\n\\\\nUNCTAD has just released a new edition of its [Investment Policy Monitor](https://unctad.org/publication/investment-policies-energy-transition-incentives-and-disincentives) on investment policies for the energy transition. This Monitor reviews and analyses policies related to some of the main incentives and disincentives to clean energy investment, expanding on the findings and analysis presented in the World Investment Report 2023: Investing in sustainable energy for all (WIR23) and further drawing from the insights and the discussion at UNCTAD\\'s 8th World Investment Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October 2023.\\\\n\\\\nUNCTAD\\'s World Investment Report 2023 highlights a worrisome increase in the SDG investment gap, surpassing $4 trillion annually in developing countries alone, with energy investment needs estimated at $2.2 trillion per year. Successful energy transition necessitates significant investment in renewable energy projects, the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, investing in renewables and clean energy is hindered by a range of specific risks and challenges, leading to higher costs of capital, especially in emerging and developing countries. Factors such as the natural resources endowment, the quality of the regulatory environment, market size and maturity, and economic and political uncertainty determine the unique potential and risk profile of each country.\\\\n\\\\nPolicies and regulations play a pivotal role in both de-risking and incentivizing investment in the clean energy sector. The Monitor thus reviews and analyses 800 renewable energy policies around the world, identifying the key policy tools employed by countries in different regions and at varying levels of development to promote renewable investments.\\\\n\\\\nThe Monitor’s findings reveal that existing policy frameworks aimed at promoting investment in the energy transition are notably inadequate, especially in poorer nations. Around the world, two-thirds of countries have adopted renewable energy policies. However, only half of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and one-third of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have done so. While developed and emerging economies have integrated private investment promotion mechanisms into over 70 per cent of their renewable energy policies, the same holds true for only 24 per cent of policies in LDCs and 17 percent of those in SIDS.\\\\n\\\\nWhile most developed economies use targeted investment promotion policies, many developing countries use generic tax incentives – applicable to investment in any industry – that do not address the specificities of energy investment projects. In recent times, auctions and tenders for renewable energy projects have gained traction across all country groups.\\\\n\\\\nThe monitor also provides an overview of existing clean energy transition policies in technologies and fuels that would allow the decarbonization of the traditional power sector. While ultimately the policy objective is to phase out fossil fuels, thermal power plants will continue to play a role in ensuring energy security for many countries in the years to come. To curb their environmental impact, broader adoption of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, cofiring, and low-carbon fuels is key. At present, policies and initiatives to promote investment in such technologies are predominantly confined to developed countries and large emerging economies.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, this edition of the Investment Policy Monitor also highlights trends in the evolution of fossil fuel subsidies around the world, which represent a disincentive to the promotion of investment in clean energy. The value of fossil fuel subsidies has reached a staggering $1 trillion, far surpassing support for renewable energy. Gradually phasing out these subsidies, although complex for many countries, would incentivize investments in renewables.\\\\n\\\\nDownload it [here](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcbinf2023d8_en.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 28: Arrow](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/arrow.png)![Image 29: Arrow](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/arrow.png)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 30: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/Content/images/logo-white.png)\\\\n\\\\n[UNCTAD Home](https://unctad.org/)|[UNCTAD Investment](https://unctad.org/en/pages/DIAE/DIAE.aspx)|[World Investment Reports](https://worldinvestmentreport.unctad.org/)|[World Investment Forum](https://worldinvestmentforum.unctad.org/#/ms-1/1)\\\\n\\\\n CONTACT \\\\n\\\\n[](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/contact)\\\\n\\\\n FOLLOW US \\\\n\\\\n[](https://twitter.com/unctadwif)[](https://www.youtube.com/user/UNCTADInvestment)\\\\n\\\\n UNCTAD - Palais des Nations, 8-14, Av. de la Paix, 1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland \\\\n\\\\n ©[Copyright](https://unctad.org/copyright) | [Privacy notice](https://unctad.org/privacy) | [Terms of use](https://unctad.org/terms)\\\\n\\\\nSign up for our Newsletter\\\\n\\\\n![Image 31](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\\\\n\\\\nOriginal text\\\\n\\\\nRate this translation\\\\n\\\\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\\\\n\"}, {\"title\": \"Decoding Renewable Energy Subsidies Across Continents\", \"url\": \"https://energypedia.co/decoding-renewable-energy-subsidies-across-continents/\", \"content\": \"Governments provide these subsidies to address market barriers, such as high upfront costs of renewable technologies and competition from cheaper fossil fuels.

Yet, behind this remarkable growth lies a critical enabler: government subsidies. From tax credits that make solar panels affordable for homeowners to grants that fund groundbreaking wind energy projects, subsidies act as a financial backbone, propelling nations toward ambitious climate goals.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, not all subsidy programs are created equal. Across continents, the approaches to incentivizing renewable energy vary widely, reflecting differences in economic priorities, resource availability, and political will. Some regions have mastered the art of balancing market dynamics with fiscal support, while others grapple with inefficiencies and challenges that stifle progress.\\\\n\\\\nThis article delves into the diverse landscape of renewable energy subsidies worldwide, unraveling how these financial tools are shaping the global energy transition. By examining successes, challenges, and regional nuances, we aim to shed light on what works, what doesn’t, and what the future might hold for a subsidy-driven renewable energy revolution.\\\\n\\\\n### **What Are Renewable Energy Subsidies?**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies are financial mechanisms designed to encourage the adoption and development of sustainable energy sources. These subsidies come in various forms, including tax credits, which reduce the tax liabilities of individuals or businesses investing in renewable energy systems; grants, which provide upfront funding for renewable projects; and feed-in tariffs, which guarantee fixed prices for energy producers who supply electricity from renewable sources to the grid. Other forms include loan guarantees, rebates, and performance-based incentives, each tailored to specific energy needs and market conditions.\\\\n\\\\nGovernments provide these subsidies to address market barriers, such as high upfront costs of renewable technologies and competition from cheaper fossil fuels. By making green energy more economically viable, subsidies encourage innovation, attract private investment, and drive economies of scale. They also play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning national energy policies with international climate agreements like the Paris Accord.\\\\n\\\\nThe importance of renewable energy subsidies cannot be overstated in the fight against climate change. By accelerating the transition to cleaner energy, these subsidies not only mitigate environmental risks but also promote energy security and create economic opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.\\\\n\\\\n### **Subsidy Frameworks in Different Continents**\\\\n\\\\n**North America**\\\\n\\\\nIn North America, subsidies play a pivotal role in renewable energy development. The United States has made significant strides with policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which allocates billions in tax credits for renewable energy projects and clean energy manufacturing. State-level initiatives further bolster these efforts, such as California’s solar rebate programs and Texas’s wind energy incentives. Similarly, Canada supports green energy through federal grants, tax credits, and research funding, emphasizing a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.\\\\n\\\\n**Europe**\\\\n\\\\nEurope’s commitment to renewable energy is anchored in the European Green Deal, a comprehensive policy package aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU employs a mix of subsidy mechanisms, including carbon pricing, which penalizes high emitters, and renewable energy auctions, where companies compete for contracts based on cost-effectiveness. These tools have propelled countries like Denmark and Spain into renewable energy leadership positions.\\\\n\\\\n**Asia**\\\\n\\\\nIn Asia, subsidies reflect the continent’s diverse economic and environmental priorities. China, the world’s largest renewable energy investor, provides extensive subsidies for solar and wind projects, coupled with low-interest loans and tax incentives. India has adopted innovative schemes like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) for solar manufacturing, while Japan focuses on funding offshore wind projects. However, balancing subsidies with rapid economic growth remains a challenge for many Asian countries.\\\\n\\\\n**Africa**\\\\n\\\\nAfrica faces unique challenges in implementing renewable energy subsidies due to limited financial resources and infrastructural gaps. However, there are success stories, such as South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), which has attracted significant private investment. This program demonstrates how targeted subsidies can catalyze green energy development, even in resource-constrained regions.\\\\n\\\\n**South America**\\\\n\\\\nSouth America, particularly Brazil, has emerged as a renewable energy leader, thanks to its abundant natural resources and robust subsidy frameworks. Brazil’s government provides incentives for wind and bioenergy projects, leveraging regional cooperation and international funding. This has positioned the country as a global model for renewable energy integration.\\\\n\\\\n### **Case Studies of Success and Challenges**\\\\n\\\\n**Success: Germany’s Feed-in Tariff Program**\\\\n\\\\nGermany’s feed-in tariff (FiT) program is a textbook example of how subsidies can successfully drive renewable energy adoption. Introduced in the early 2000s, the program guaranteed fixed payments to renewable energy producers for feeding electricity into the grid. This stable pricing model encouraged widespread investment in solar and wind energy, transforming Germany into a renewable energy powerhouse. By 2020, renewable sources accounted for over 40% of the country’s energy mix, showcasing the long-term impact of consistent and well-designed subsidies.\\\\n\\\\n**Challenges: Inefficiencies and Corruption**\\\\n\\\\nHowever, not all subsidy programs achieve their intended outcomes. In some regions, inefficiencies and corruption have undermined the effectiveness of renewable energy subsidies. For instance, poorly targeted subsidies can result in funds being allocated to projects with limited impact, while a lack of transparency can lead to misuse of resources. These issues highlight the importance of robust governance and monitoring mechanisms to ensure subsidies fulfill their intended purpose.\\\\n\\\\n### **Balancing Effectiveness with Sustainability**\\\\n\\\\nStriking the right balance between subsidy effectiveness and fiscal sustainability remains a challenge. Over-reliance on subsidies can create dependency, deterring market competitiveness once the financial support is withdrawn. Policymakers must design frameworks that gradually reduce subsidies as technologies mature, encouraging private sector innovation and investment to take over.\\\\n\\\\n### **Impact of Subsidies on Global Energy Transition**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies have significantly accelerated innovation and adoption. By reducing the cost of technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage, subsidies have made renewable energy more accessible to households and businesses alike. This has driven economies of scale, lowering costs further and making renewables increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.\\\\n\\\\nThe economic and social benefits of subsidies are also profound. They create jobs in emerging industries, improve energy access in underserved regions, and reduce energy costs for consumers. For instance, subsidies have enabled rural electrification projects in developing countries, empowering communities with clean, affordable energy.\\\\n\\\\nDespite their success, subsidies come with challenges. Dependency on financial support can distort markets, while abrupt policy changes can disrupt industry growth. Countries must navigate these complexities carefully, ensuring subsidies are both effective and adaptable to evolving energy markets.\\\\n\\\\n### **The Future of Renewable Energy Subsidies**\\\\n\\\\nLooking ahead, the future of renewable energy subsidies lies in performance-based incentives and innovative financing mechanisms. These approaches reward efficiency and outcomes rather than blanket financial support. For example, subsidies could be tied to energy output or carbon reductions, ensuring funds are allocated to the most impactful projects.\\\\n\\\\nInternational cooperation will also play a crucial role. Organizations like the United Nations (UN) and World Trade Organization (WTO) can help harmonize subsidy policies, preventing trade disputes and fostering global collaboration. Emerging financial tools, such as green bonds and carbon credits, are poised to complement traditional subsidies, unlocking additional funding for renewable energy initiatives.\\\\n\\\\n### **Conclusion**\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy subsidies are indispensable in shaping a sustainable future. They have spurred innovation, driven adoption, and delivered tangible economic and environmental benefits across continents. However, as the renewable energy market evolves, subsidy frameworks must adapt to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nPolicymakers and stakeholders must work together to refine subsidy mechanisms, embracing innovation and international collaboration. By doing so, we can build a resilient, equitable, and clean energy future for all.\\\\n\\\\n### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**\\\\n\\\\n**1.

At the international level, the Agreement was hailed as a turning point of collective global action to combat climate change after many rounds of negotiations under the UNFCCC umbrella. For the first time, all countries agreed to keep global average temperature increase to “well below 2°C aiming for 1.5°C” with each contributing their part at a self-determined speed and scale. The so-called ambition mechanism with the Nationally Determined Contributions at the centre was born, embedded in a framework of processes and milestones to enable assessment of progress towards the collective goal.\\\\nSince then, the implementation of the ambition mechanism has proven slower than what is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the scientific community’s warnings have grown in urgency and alarm. Indeed, in many parts of the world the impacts of climate change can already be felt, in numerous natural disasters, heat waves, droughts, floods, which threaten the livelihoods of millions.\\\\nAgainst a backdrop of multiple global crises, rising geopolitical tensions and increasing disinformation campaigns, it is important to not only reflect on the gaps of what hasn’t happened but also what has been achieved over the last decade. A closer look at progress will provide important insights into the dynamics of change that we can build on as well as nurture a sense of purpose for the climate community to prepare itself for the next crucial – and undoubtedly difficult – decade.\\\\nThis paper gives an overview of what has been achieved in the last years of international climate policy at the global level along different dimensions of the transition towards a zero emissions world. The focus is deliberately on the positive shifts that can be observed, recognising that these are insufficient to move us to where we need to be but remind us that not all is lost yet. The paper is structured along five thematic areas, covering awareness and civil action, policy and governance, investors and business, as well as the energy and industry sectors. In all of these areas positive shifts are under way. In some cases the shifts are only small and need significant acceleration and scaling. Some have positively surprised us and are already past positive tipping points and “simply” need continuation. All show that change is possible and is happening, sometimes faster than was previously expected or thought even possible. Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 2 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Under each theme we highlight the main positive trends that have been observed in the last decade. It is not meant as a comprehensive compendium but rather a collection of evidence underpinned by data where possible, sometimes anecdotal. The intention is to provide a perspective of change at the global level and not to zoom into specific geographies. However, there are of course significant regional and local differences in many of the observed trends which cannot be considered in depth within the scope of this exercise.\\\\nSHIFT 1 Awarness & civil action Climate change discourse has become mainstream. Civil and legal action pushes governments and companies.\\\\nSHIFT 2 Vision, goals & policies Widely recognised that emissions have to be reduced to zero by every country across the economy.\\\\nSHIFT 3 Investors & business Every investor and every business feels pressure to act on climate.\\\\nSHIFT 4 Energy supply Renewables reached cost parity with fossils and power systems are shifting to decentralised, ﬂexible models.\\\\nSHIFT 5 Electriﬁcation & industry Electriﬁcation in transport and buildings has progressed signiﬁcantly and all industry is now working on zero carbon strategies.\\\\nParis Agreement Goal Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 3 AWARENESS & CIVIL ACTION SHIFT 1 Climate change is now central in the public and political discourse in many parts of the world. Knowledge and awareness on the causes and impacts of climate change has increased across many parts of the population. This is the result of growing media coverage, mainstreaming climate change into education and curricula and not least because the effects of climate change are increasingly felt by many. The decade also saw climate protests and social movements growing in strength, influencing the political debate and keeping businesses and societies on their toes. Advances in attribution science made climate litigation possible.\\\\nClimate change discourse has become mainstream and is a subject of debate in all parts of society, driving social movements and civil action.\\\\nOnly parts of society were meaningfully aware and concerned about climate change. BEFORE NOW 4 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement THE MEDIA NOW COVERS REGULAR STORIES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND REACHES PEOPLE THROUGH DIVERSE CHANNELS, INCLUDING MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS SPECIALISED NEWS CHANNELS.\\\\nThe Media and Climate Change Observatory tracks newspaper coverage of climate change in seven regions around the world ( Figure 1). While coverage goes up and down, there is a clear growth trend since 2015. There are peaks around times of specific events, political, scientific or climatic, as well as dips where other issues (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022) grabbed front pages. An all-time high was observed in 2010, following the disappointing outcomes of the UNFCCC COP in Copenhagen in late 2009, when the costs of the international community\\'s failure to set binding mitigation commitments was underscored by a slew of extreme weather events not seen in almost 100 years (WMO, 2013). Figure 1 2004 – 2022 World Newspaper Coverage of Climate Change or Global Warming Note: Articles per source refers to the average number of articles in a given month across 127 newspaper, radio and TV sources in 58 countries and seven different regions around the world. Source: MeCCO, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nArticles per source 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 5 The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report notes that climate change media coverage across 59 countries has increased from 47,000 articles in 2016 to 2017 to about 87,000 in 2020 to 2021 (IPCC, 2022a). There are of course significant regional differences. While coverage in the Global North is generally more frequent and focusses more on climate science, coverage in the Global South more frequently features links to development, societal changes and impacts on humans and the associated challenges (Hase et al., 2021).\\\\nHowever, there is also a noticeable increase in the level of fake news around climate change related topics. Research on Twitter data during the international climate negotiations between 2014 and 2021 investigated the links between climate change and political polarisation and found a four-fold increase in ideological polarisation since COP21 driven by right wing populist activity (Falkenberg et al., 2022). Also false balance reporting or “bothsideism” that is common in media reporting on climate change leads audiences to doubt the scientific consensus and affects people’s ability to distinguish fact from fiction (Imundo and Rapp, 2022). News fatigue on climate change may also lead to people turning away from the topic.\\\\nAN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT THEIR LIVES.\\\\nCoupled with an increased awareness and understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change and in particular the role that individuals play, there is rising concern that climate change will cause personal harm. In several major economies the number of people who have expressed intense concern that climate change will harm them personally within their lifetime has increased sharply to an average of 37% of people surveyed sharing the concern (Bell et al., 2021).\\\\nResults from a BBC survey (BBC, 2021) covering 17 countries across the world shows that people increasingly perceive climate change as a serious issue. Where in 2014 only around 40% of respondents voiced concern, the share increased to over 60% in 2020. Similarly, the 2021 “Peoples Climate Vote” (UNDP and University of Oxford, 2021) uncovered that the majority of surveyed people across 50 countries considered climate change to be a global emergency. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia this was the case for 85% of respondents, and for 72% of Western Europeans and North Americans, 64% in Arab states, 63% in Latin America, Caribbean and Asia Pacific and 61% in Sub Saharan Africa. At least in principle people also seem to be willing to act on climate change even if it comes at a personal financial expense. For example, over 80% of people in Nigeria and Kenya stated that they would be willing to pay an extra tax to support climate action. In fact, in many emerging and developing economies the vast majority of people surveyed shared this view. At the lower end were some countries in the Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 6 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Global North where numbers dropped to as low as 38% (Leiserowitz et al., 2022) arguably influenced by the fact that in many of these economies measures have already been implemented that affect peoples’ finances. People in the Global North and South see that responsibility for addressing climate change lies mostly with government with an increasing number of people supporting propositions that their governments set ambitious climate targets; concretely 43% of people surveyed in 2015 versus 58% in 2021 (BBC, 2021).\\\\nOn the flipside it is noticeable in public debates that while people theoretically support climate action it is proving rather difficult to introduce concrete measures that would affect the lifestyle of individuals, not least because populist actors use climate change to divide society in the political debate. In some cases, even where public demand for climate action is strong political decision makers follow a few loud or influential actors (see for example (Kinnunen, 2021)). People may be more aware and more knowledgeable about the problem, but at the same time it remains very difficult to channel this into the rapid and far-reaching transitions necessary to not only combat climate change but also prepare for it.\\\\nCLIMATE MOVEMENTS, PROTESTS AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE HAVE KEPT CLIMATE CHANGE HIGH ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND IN PEOPLES’ MINDS PUSHING GOVERNMENTS TO ACT.\\\\nDriven by a growing perception of climate change as a threat to our society, several climate movements have emerged, took to the streets and made headlines. Youth are at the forefront of many of these movements, as young people tend to have a more acute sense of their future being at risk. A highly politized youth contributes to a perception of climate change as a generational conflict, beyond North – South and social divides. Prominent movements, such as Fridays for Future, have originated in the Global North but have sparked protests and climate strikes around the world ( Figure 2).\\\\nCivil disobedience movements, such as Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil or Last Generation, have drawn attention to the climate crisis in recent years. This contributes to keeping the climate agenda high on people’s perception and also forces political decision makers to address the topic. As a result, governments and societies are permanently reminded of the need for action. In many instances they have started to change course. For example, spurred by climate protests, the German government was sued in constitutional court on the grounds that its 2019 Climate Change Act was an insufficient response to the impending climate crisis. The Constitutional Court found in favour of the plaintiffs and directed the government to revise the law to cut emissions more rapidly in 2030, which it subsequently did (Bundesverfassungsgericht, 2021).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 7 Countries with climate protests Countries without climate protests Figure 2 Countries with climate policy protests since 2022 Source: Carnegie, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAt the same time there are noticeable counter protests by specific groups which fear negative impacts from climate action (see for example the protests by Dutch farmers (Al Jazeera, 2022)). These counter movements are often spurred by populist actors which use civil action and in particular civil disobedience to further polarise people on the topic. In some countries civil spaces are being closed down specifically targeting climate protests (for example, the UK Public Ordinance Act (Laville, 2023)). ADVANCES IN ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE SUPPORTS CIVIL ACTION IN A GROWING NUMBER OF CLIMATE LITIGATION CASES.\\\\nA growing body of scientific literature and evidence on the causes and impacts of climate change as well as solutions is laying the foundation for a better informed political and public discourse. The advances in attribution science in particular have paved the way for an increasing number of climate lawsuits brought against governments and companies (see also Shift 3). As policymakers and companies are slow to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks and change their practices to address the climate crisis, individuals and organisations are increasingly challenging their insufficient climate action in court ( Figure 3).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 8 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Figure 3 Total climate change litigation cases in US and in other countries Source: Setzer and Higham, 2022; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAttribution science looks into the relationship between climate change, natural weather patterns and climate variability. It helps to understand how climate change affects weather events as well as how emissions drive climate change and its impacts. Advances in climate source attribution mark significant progress in being able to understand better the direct links between sources and impact to inform policy and strategies to reduce emissions (Merner, 2023). In particular a publication in 2014 that identified the 90 companies most responsible for global carbon and methane emissions between 1751 and 2010 (Heede, 2014) provided the scientific grounds for legal action (Sato et al., 2023). Although the knowledge and evidence on climate change, its drivers, impacts and solutions with regard to how to address the crisis, is increasing, such evidence, however, is not sufficiently entered into the political and public debate. The scientific discourse often remains in a silo, and a growing number of political actors and their supporters reject it outright.

Where previously discussions focussed on specific sectors and the trade-offs between them, a zero emissions economy perspective is now the norm including in economies in the Global South. Whilst aspirational targets have not yet translated into global emission reductions or aligned mid-term targets, the projected emissions curve has flattened. Climate policies now cover most if not all relevant sectors leading to a significantly improved outlook on the estimated temperature rise albeit not yet aligned with the needed 1.5°C.\\\\nWidely recognised that emissions have to be reduced to zero by every country across the economy.\\\\nPolicy debate centred on incremental emission reductions and trade-offs between sectors and countries.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 10 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF A ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION ECONOMY HAS BECOME THE ACCEPTED NORM AROUND THE WORLD.\\\\nThe global agreement to keep temperature increase to well below 2°C or 1.5°C enshrined in the Paris Agreement, means that CO2 emissions need to be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 (IPCC, 2018, 2022b). Prior to the Paris Agreement and the ensuing IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018, emission targets were typically set at sectoral levels and aggregated to national targets. Often sectors were pitched against each other. A common notion was that reductions would happen sector by sector sequentially in an incremental way. A zero emissions world was not part of the policy discussions.\\\\nBhutan was the first country to set a net-zero target in 2015. Other countries, regions, and cities followed quickly. By end 2021 90% of the global economy was covered by a net zero target stimulating a policy discourse on full decarbonisation that was previously politically not acceptable. The new framing of full decarbonisation has also propagated into sectoral policy making. Coal phase out, 100% zero emission vehicles and zero-emission steel are now considered part of the required policy packages of countries. This transformed the policy toolkit from incentivising incremental change to supporting the 100% transformation. Although the widespread adoption of long term zero emissions targets represents a significant shift in the climate policy discourse, many targets are so far aspirational and not underpinned by sufficient action. The Climate Action Tracker analysed the quality of net zero targets of 41 key emitters and concluded that 74% of global emissions were covered by targets of insufficient or poor quality (Climate Action Tracker, 2022a). Other risks include the assumption of the role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies for both natural and technological approaches given issues of space and permanence of the former and feasibility and scalability of the latter.\\\\nEXPECTATION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR THIS DECADE FLIPPED FROM “EVER INCREASING” TO “AT LEAST FLAT”.\\\\nWith the introduction of the ambition mechanism of the Paris Agreement, for the first time all signatory countries submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to outline their mitigation commitments. Previously, many emerging and developing economies had not set any emission reduction target at all, and many rejected the notion of (binding) mitigation targets considering development needs and the historic responsibility of industrialised countries. The NDCs led to higher ambition in 2030 targets globally. Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 11 In many countries emissions are starting to decline. Emissions projections associated with current policies for the G20, for example, significantly improved since the adoption of the Paris Agreement ( Figure 4). The projected emissions for 2030 are about 15% lower in absolute terms compared to 2015 (Nascimento, Kuramochi and Höhne, 2022). Emissions in 2020 were temporarily low due to the COVID-19 crisis, but a suite of implemented policies, fast uptake of renewable energy and the price shock of gas leads to an outlook of at least flat global emissions from now on. The ever-increasing trend is reversed.\\\\nPeaking global emissions is critical, because with rising annual emissions, temperature increase accelerates each year. With stable emissions, temperature continues to increase but in an almost linear manner. Only with zero emissions, temperature stops to increase.

Besides, projections are expectations on how the future develops. In a politically and economically volatile world things may turn out quite differently.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 12 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN SCOPE AND NOW COVER ALL RELEVANT SECTORS IN MOST COUNTRIES.\\\\nIn the past decade the number and coverage of climate policies has increased significantly (Eskander and Fankhauser, 2020; Nascimento et al., 2022). The expansion of climate policies can be seen on the national level: where previously typically only industrialised and more advanced economies had climate policies in place, this is now the case in many more countries. Expansion also happened at sectoral level, with policies being discussed or in place for all climate relevant sectors. For many years the focus had been on the energy supply, in particular the power sector. In G20 countries the use of various policy instruments has increased steadily over the past two decades (Nascimento et al., 2022). The share of countries that had mitigation policy instruments in place rose across all sectoral categories, albeit to different extents in different sectors and for different policy instruments ( Figure 5). Among G20 countries electricity and heat generation has the greatest number of policies in place, and the agriculture and forestry sector the fewest.\\\\n20 40 60 80 100 Share of G20 countries with instruments in force (%) Direct investments Voluntary approaches Codes and standards Key policy instruments: Fiscal and ﬁnancial incentives Market-based instruments Electricity & Heat 2000 2010 2020 Industry 2000 2010 2020 Land transport 2000 2010 2020 Buildings 2000 2010 2020 Agriculture & Forestry 2000 2010 2020 0 Source: Nascimento et al., 2022; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nFigure 5 Climate policy coverage in different sectors over time Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 13 An increasing number of countries are phasing out or at least plan to phase out fossil fuels in electricity. A total of 75 countries had agreed to phase out coal or not develop new unabated coal power plants in 2022 (IEA, 2023a). In particular outside of China the coal pipeline is shrinking. At the same time many countries are still expanding coal capacity. Globally the coal fleet is still growing albeit at a rate of less than 1% (Global Energy Monitor et al., 2023). The recent energy crisis prompted a switch from gas to coal (Wiatros-Motyka, 2023) and at the same time significant investments into LNG infrastructure. Overall, despite the observed increase in the number and coverage of climate policies, slow progress towards reducing global emissions and meeting the collective Paris climate goals calls for more comprehensive climate change mitigation policies to be adopted and implemented. Several countries have not yet adopted policies to meet their original NDCs, which were set more than seven years ago. Coverage is still incomplete in particular in countries with fast growing emissions (Nascimento and Höhne, 2023). For the Paris Agreement ambition raising mechanism to work, countries need to adopt sufficient policies to meet their targets. Increasing the ambition of targets alone widens the credibility gap between international targets and national action and undermines the Paris Agreement (Nascimento et al., 2023).\\\\nTHE OUTLOOK OF TEMPERATURE INCREASE BY 2100 HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY.\\\\nTemperature projections have continuously improved our outlook. At the time of the adoption of the Paris Agreement, temperature increases by the end of the century from implemented policies of 3.6 to 3.9°C were thought to be likely. Today these high levels are thankfully no longer likely, but a full degree lower: 2.7°C ( Figure 6). The effect of Paris targets led to a significant downward adjustment of projected temperature. The recent wave of national net zero emission targets could, if fully implemented, substantially reduce best estimates of projected global average temperature increase bringing the Paris Agreement goal within reach (Höhne et al., 2021). The most optimistic interpretations of these targets lead to temperature increase as low as 1.7–1.8°C by the end of the century (Höhne et al., 2021; Meinshausen et al., 2022; Rogelj et al., 2023). Although the pathways to these low temperature levels are currently not underpinned by concrete policies, they for the first time give hope that the global temperature increase can indeed be kept to below 2°C.\\\\nThe flipside is clear. Although the projected temperature increase associated with our current policy trajectory is progressively improving, we are still far from the required 1.5°C. If the world continues on its current path the impacts of climate change will be catastrophic. On current emission levels the remaining carbon budget to stay within a 1.5°C increase will be depleted in a few years.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 14 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement 2009 2022 Global temperature increase in 2100 (°C) 2015 Paris Agreement Policies & actions Pledges & targets 2030 targets only 2 4 3.5 3 2.5 Figure 6 Climate Action Tracker’s estimates of global temperature increase has improved over time Source: Climate Action Tracker, 2020; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 15 INVESTORS & BUSINESSES SHIFT 3 Driven by societal pressure, investors and businesses increasingly recognise the climate crisis as a threat to their business models and investment portfolios. Corporate reporting and disclosure on climate has become mainstream – in many cases a legal requirement. At the same time, investors and corporate boards are increasingly actively seeking out business opportunities associated with the low carbon transformation. New business models and innovations are driving change in several markets and shake up traditional players.\\\\nEvery investor and every business feels the pressure to act on climate.\\\\nClimate change is one of many considerations of investors and businesses and still rather a niche topic.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 16 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement CLIMATE IS NOW FIRMLY ON THE AGENDA OF THE FINANCE WORLD. RETAIL INVESTORS ARE DEMANDING AND ASSET MANAGERS ARE INCREASINGLY PROVIDING “SUSTAINABLE” INVESTMENT OPTIONS.\\\\nRetail investors are increasingly demanding “sustainable options”. For instance, a 2020 survey found that two thirds of French and German retail investors want to invest sustainably (Dupre, Bayer and Santacruz, 2020). Despite scandals, accusations of greenwashing, outflows in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and diverse definitions of what can be considered “sustainable”, asset managers are responding to this demand: according to the Financial Times as of July 2023, net assets of global sustainable funds, are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels at USD 2.834 trillion (Ross, 2023), while the sector as a whole is experiencing outflows. The growth is driven by both retail as well as institutional investors, including pensions funds and insurance companies, who respond to increasing awareness and perception of climate change risks of their clients. Nine of ten asset managers believe that the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their investment strategy will improve returns, and a majority claims this has already proven to be the case. In 2021, 84% of asset owners globally reported to be implementing or evaluating sustainable investment strategies compared to about 53% three years earlier (PwC, 2022). From its niche existence over more than a decade ago, sustainable investing has now become a standard model in the finance world, and climate change has firmly arrived on the agenda of financial institutions. A growing number of asset owners and managers are joining international climate initiatives and are setting dedicated climate targets. 90% of the assets of the 50 largest asset managers are now under a net zero or carbon/climate neutrality target (Kachi and Marquardt, 2022). The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was founded in 2021 and rapidly increased its membership, now representing USD130 trillion in assets (Kachi and Marquardt, 2022). Also the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets is increasingly on the radar (Semieniuk et al., 2022). As a result of these trends, fewer and fewer banks are willing to finance coal mining or coal fired power plants making the financing of new fossil fuel projects increasingly difficult (Green and Vallee, 2022).\\\\nHowever, despite these promising trends and declarations, trillions of USD are still flowing into projects and activities that are not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement sometimes directly undermining climate objectives. In particular, the recent energy crisis prompted profits of oil and gas companies to soar in some cases sparking new investor interest (Bousso, 2023). Unfortunately, many fund managers tend more towards reducing their portfolio’s potential downside risk resulting from climate change rather than directly towards having an actual impact on reducing emissions. In many cases they fail to fund the potentially Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 17 riskier breakthrough technologies that are key for decarbonisation. Moreover, the sustainability labels of investments do not always exclude harmful activities as for example, some ESG funds were found to be invested in fossil assets (Inman, 2023). In any case, much more needs to be done to tighten up definitions of “sustainable” and to take advantage of the opportunities that decarbonisation offers. This will be critical in order for the trillions in invested assets to provide momentum and fund the trillions needed to decarbonise the global economy. CLIMATE LITIGATION IS A GROWING RISK TOWARDS DIRTY BUSINESS MODELS AND COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO WAKE UP TO TRANSITION RISKS.\\\\nClimate litigation, supported by improved attribution science (see Shift 1), is increasingly recognised as an effective way to hold companies accountable. The first corporate climate litigation case was recorded in 1995, and from 2000 a growing number of lawsuits were filed against oil, gas and electricity companies in the US (Sato et al., 2023). According to research by Grantham Institute, since 2015 the number of climate change related lawsuits against governments and companies has more than doubled to a total number of 2000 cases globally, a quarter of which in the last three years (Setzer and Higham, 2022). In 2022, legal action was filed in particular against fossil fuel corporations outside the US. Increasingly also companies in other sectors are targeted, including in food and agriculture, transport, plastics and finance. The claims particularly focus on “climate washing” of providing false or misleading information on climate commitments, failure to disclose climate risks or making false product claims (Sato et al., 2023). Climate litigation is increasingly considered an additional transition risk by investors. For some years financial markets have already been considering climate related risks, physical and transitional, and started to integrate these into their evaluation and decision processes. Evidence suggests that litigation can affect company performance. Even filing a lawsuit can make a difference. One recent study found that being brought to court – even before an unfavourable judgement can reduce the firm value of carbon majors on average by 0.57%, increasing to 1.5% following unfavourable judgements (Sato et al., 2023). While climate litigation led to some positive outcomes that prominently exposed companies’ responsibility for climate change, for example the ruling against RWE or Shell Netherlands (Weller and Tran, 2022) and contributes to an increased risk awareness of companies as well as diversification of business towards more sustainable activities (Böff, 2023), it has not yet led to a significant shift away from dirty business models of affected companies or their peers. More needs to be done to change the trajectory of whole sectors – not only in selected jurisdictions but Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 18 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement also around the world. And although climate risks are increasingly understood, such risks remain in the shadow of continued promising (short term) returns of high carbon investments.\\\\nAS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL PRESSURE, COMPANIES INCREASINGLY PREPARE CLIMATE PLANS AND IMPROVE THEIR CLIMATE GOVERNANCE AND DISCLOSURE.\\\\nThe interest of investors in climate risks as well as an increasingly aware public pushed companies to talk about climate impacts and risks of their activities. A growing number of companies is setting climate targets, mainly emission reduction targets as well as increasingly net zero targets. In 2015 only 30% of companies had set emission reduction targets and only 2% net zero targets. More recent data shows that currently of the world’s largest 2000 publicly listed companies by revenue nearly half have set or in the process of setting a net zero target (Hale et al., 2021).\\\\n2023 Net Zero Stocktake 2023 Number of net zero targets 0 200 600 1000 2022 Net Zero Stocktake 2022 2021 Black et al., 2021 Figure 7 Decarbonisation targets set by publicly listed companies globally Source: Net Zero Tracker, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nReporting on climate change performance and risks is also increasingly mainstream for companies. Among the Standard&Poors 500 companies more than half have started to disclose climate risks in annual reports, 71% disclose carbon emissions data in other reports or on their websites (Conference-board.org, 2022). The Financial Stability Board created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 19 (TCFD) driving standardisation and scrutiny in this area. Increasingly countries are moving towards legally mandating reporting on environmental and climate related risks such as the EU (European Commission, 2023). The climate litigation cases, which particularly target misleading disclosure and information provided by companies, are forcing more scrutiny on reporting practices and corporate claims and are helping to call out greenwashing. Competition among companies, in particular within the same sector, increases pressure on peers. Although not yet a race to the top, competition on climate performance is mounting.\\\\nReporting on greenhouse gas emissions has moved from typically reporting on only scope 1 (direct) and 2 (purchased energy) emissions to increasingly include scope 3 emissions covering the entire value chain of products and services. This is particularly relevant as on average scope 3 emissions account for 75% of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions (Hadziosmanovic, Rahimi and Bhatia, 2022a). According to CDP data, the number of companies reporting on scope 3 emission increased from 936 in 2010 to 3,317 companies in 2021 ( Figure 8). Interestingly in 2021, the majority of companies appeared to track scope 3 emissions but did not agree to publicly report on them.\\\\nFigure 8 Number of companies that publicly disclose Scope 3 emissions Publicly disclosed with scope 3 emissions reported Not made publicly available Publicly disclosed with no scope 3 emissions reported Number of companies 0 4000 8000 12000 2010 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2011 2013 1981 2567 4492 2229 2038 2184 1599 1199 2054 1824 1509 1368 1016 4310 1952 1738 1515 1316 Number of companies reporting on GHG emissions 0 4000 8000 12000 936 938 1029 1438 1229 1445 1876 1704 1640 2012 3,317 companies 936 companies Source: Hadziosmanovic, Rahimi and Bhatia, 2022b; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 20 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Corporate greenwashing is however still ubiquitous. The majority of net zero targets are not aligned with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement and are not underpinned by sufficient action. Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative on corporate climate action, found that despite long term targets, there continue to be major gaps in companies’ medium term rapid reduction targets, a lack of accounting for scope 3 emissions, and “only 5% of focus companies explicitly commit to align their capex plans with their long-term GHG reduction targets” (Climate Action 100+, 2022). Further, the role of carbon offsets in companies’ decarbonisation strategies is problematic as offsetting one’s own emissions detracts from stopping high carbon activities and rethinking harmful business models. NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW PLAYERS AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESSES HAVE LED TO A GREATER RECOGNITION THAT MAIN POLLUTERS, IN PARTICULAR, NEED TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO SURVIVE.\\\\nIn the past decades many smaller green industry players have actively pushed the development and commercialisation of technologies and services, in particular in the energy sector. The perseverance of these companies, which often battled against unfavourable regulations, bureaucratic hurdles and skewed markets, led to the establishment of green industry across the world. In some cases this happened by forming green advocacy alliances with different actors that eventually pushed governments to change the rules (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006). The growth in green businesses resulted in an increasing number of green jobs. While the majority of these jobs are associated with the energy sector ( Figure 9) such jobs have emerged across other sectors including finance, fashion and transport (Kimbrough, 2021).\\\\nIn many sectors, new players or visionary incumbent companies have pushed the introduction of climate friendly technologies, and in some cases this has led to a shift in the market where others are forced to follow to remain competitive. This can be seen, for example, in the automotive industry with e-mobility, as well as with clean steel, and heat pumps. Another shift indicator is the amount of investment flowing into green or climate technologies. For example, venture capital investment into climate technologies globally has increased sharply since 2015 ( Figure 10).\\\\nDespite noticeable positive trends and shifts, the majority of the economy has not shifted to a climate aligned model. High carbon activities remain profitable and continue to attract investments, and radical changes in business models are not happening at the necessary scale. Active lobbying by companies and their sector representatives has successfully stalled ambitious climate policies in many jurisdictions (Waldersee, 2022).\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 21 Figure 9 Evolution of global renewable energy employment Figure 10 Value of venture capital investment in climate technology worldwide Venture capital going to green or climate technologies (%) 0 4 8 12 2021 2019 2023 2017 2015 Solar heating/ cooling Wind energy Others Bioenergy Hydropower Solar photovoltaic Number of jobs (million) 0 4 8 12 2012 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 Source: IRENA and ILO, 2022; rRe-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nSource: Dealroom.co, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 22 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ENERGY SUPPLY SHIFT 4 Renewable energy as the backbone of the energy transition has become the new normal, and the question of phasing out fossil fuels is no longer a question of “if” but “when”. Energy systems with large shares of wind and solar are increasingly the reality on the ground in many parts of the world and improving energy access for many.\\\\nRenewables reached cost parity with fossils, and power systems are shifting to decentralised, flexible models.\\\\nRenewables were not cost competitive and with low to medium penetration in base load capacity driven markets.\\\\nBEFORE NOW NewClimate Institute November 2023 23 PREDICTIONS ON GLOBAL RENEWABLES DEVELOPMENT WERE CONTINUOUSLY OUTSTRIPPED BY THE ACCELERATED REAL UPTAKE OF WIND AND SOLAR AS THEY REACHED AND BLEW PAST COST PARITY WITH FOSSILS.\\\\nOver two decades ago, renewables, specifically solar and wind, were associated with high costs limiting their accessibility in particular in finance constrained economies in the Global South. Since then, costs have decreased much faster than what had been predicted or thought realistic. The cost of solar, onshore and offshore wind fell by 60-90% in the last ten years (IPCC, 2021; RMI, 2023). New renewables are now cheaper than new fossils in 90% of the world and the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation. Despite temporary cost increases for renewables in some contexts, the gap to fossil based power generation continues to grow as prices of fuel and carbon rise even faster. New build onshore wind and solar projects are now 40% cheaper than the global benchmark for new coal and gas fired power (BloombergNEF, 2022). This has resulted in significant investments into renewable energy which surpasses fossil fuel investments by a factor of five (IEA, 2023e). New renewables are also cheaper than running existing coal or gas fire plants in half of the world which means that, on balance, shutting down fossil plants and building new renewables would save the world trillions (Allen, 2023). Source: RMI, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nFigure 11 Projected global solar deployment Actual solar deployment 2000 2040 Annual capacity addition (GW) BNEF 2015 BNEF 2020 0 300 200 100 2030 2020 2010 IEA 2017 IEA 2016 EIA 2017 Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 24 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Past predictions on the uptake of renewables were repeatedly outstripped by reality. Nobody had been able to predict how fast these technologies would grow, especially solar energy. For 20 years the International Energy Agency predicted linear growth of solar when in reality growth happened exponentially ( Figure 11).\\\\nAt the same time, renewables continue to be constrained by grid and system limitations in many parts of the world, where investments and reforms lag behind potential deployment rates. From a systems balancing perspective developing wind and solar capacities in parallel is critical. The development of wind, however, has stagnated in many countries often related to barriers, such as permitting issues, that drive up the costs of projects. Overall, despite the positive technology developments investment into fossil-based power generation continues. In particular the recent energy crisis prompted a shift back to coal and new investments into fossil infrastructure and exploration, including coal, gas and oil (Climate Action Tracker, 2022b). A PARADIGM SHIFT ON MULTIPLE LEVELS TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS STARTED THAT CANNOT BE REVERSED. THE ENERGY SYSTEM HAS CHANGED AND SO HAVE THE ACTORS.\\\\nWith the incorporation of increasing variable renewable sources, especially wind and solar, the energy system is transforming itself from one dominated by base load power plants to one with increasing decentralisation and flexibility. This shift is underpinned by the adoption and readiness of flexibility options, including demand response measures, large scale batteries and dispatchable renewable energy. Fears of intermittent renewables especially during peak load hours are gradually being overcome as renewables-based power systems prove to be reliable (Quak et al., 2018).\\\\nThe power system has become increasingly democratised and decentralised allowing new actors to become part of the solution. Feed-in schemes or net metering, amongst others, have enabled millions of households to actively participate in the energy transition by installing solar panels or other smaller scale renewable technologies. The digitalisation is supporting this market transformation turning more and more people into prosumers to support the transition. At the industry level, the last years have seen a surge in new manufacturing capacities for renewable energy technologies. For solar energy as well as batteries, the existing and announced projects are now sufficient to align with the IEA’s net zero scenario in 2030. Gaps remain for wind, heat pumps and electrolysers where growth has been more stagnant (IEA, 2023d).

This includes in particular fossil fuel dependent countries and large energy cooperations which use their respective powers to block or delay action. And whilst manufacturing capacity for renewable technologies is ramping up, critical gaps in manufacturing capacities and raw materials to enable the zero-carbon transformation remain (IEA, 2021). Broader sustainability issues associated with the production of technologies and raw materials make reconciliation of climate and sustainability goals difficult. DUE TO WIDE AVAILABILITY OF DECENTRALISED RENEWABLES ENERGY ACCESS HAS GROWN SUPPORTING ACHIEVEMENT OF IMPORTANT SDG GOALS. The energy transition has not only delivered cleaner electricity but has also enabled a larger share of the population to have access to electricity. Back in 1990, around 71% of the world population had access to electricity, increasing to 83% in 2010. The last decade saw a jump almost twice as fast as the previous decade reaching over 90% in 2020 ( Figure 13). Awareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 26 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement Electricity access through decentralised renewable energy systems has played a significant role by providing 59 million people access to tier 1 (energy access, including lighting and phone charging) systems and 15 million to tier 2 (additionally power energy-efficient household appliances such as TV electricity) by the end of 2022 (Reynolds and Paixão, 2022a). The number of people with “improved energy access through an off-grid solar product” has also bounced back from 101 million in 2021 to 104 million by the end of 2022 (Reynolds and Paixão, 2022b). The number had declined between 2019 and 2021 due to COVID-19 and supply chain issues (IEA et al., 2023a).\\\\nHowever, we are not there yet. In order to reach the goal of universal access by 2030 the annual growth rate must increase further from the 0.6% percentage points seen in recent years to 1% point per year until 2030 (IEA et al., 2023b). As recognised by the UN, a significant effort will be needed to provide stable energy access to people living in least developed and in fragile and conflict-affected countries (UNSD, 2022).\\\\nFigure 13 Percentage of population with access to electricity Population with access to electricity (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 2010 2012 2014 2016 2020 2018 Brazil US China India World Afghanistan Haiti Rwanda Note: Electricity defined as an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.\\\\nSource: World Bank, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 27 ELECTRIFICATION & INDUSTRY SHIFT 5 Actors across all economic sectors are beginning to realise that electrification through electric vehicles, heat pumps, and electric heat in industry is central to the decarbonisation and start to act accordingly. Innovation and investment has advanced significantly in the so-called “hard to abate” sectors like shipping and heavy industry.\\\\nElectrification in transport and buildings has progressed significantly and all industry is now working on zero carbon strategies.\\\\nEnergy demand and hard to abate sectors hid behind the energy supply sector to decarbonise first.\\\\nBEFORE NOW 28 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY AND IS SET TO BECOME THE NEW NORMAL.\\\\nElectric passenger cars have started to displace the internal combustion engine (ICE) and are now the new standard in some parts of the world. Major car manufacturers have made the decision to move to 100% electrified cars. The shift happened despite fierce lobbying by parts of the industry in particular in the traditional automotive base of Germany, eventually pushed by the success story of new players such as Tesla among others.\\\\nSeveral countries have now set targets and dates to phase out combustion engines including the European Economic Area (EEC), Canada, Chile and several US states (ICCT, 2023). Compared to the situation ten years ago this policy commitment, driven by a fast-changing market, was not conceivable. The growth of electric vehicles has surpassed all expectations. The latest IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) changed their global outlook of the share of electric car sales under existing policies and targets from a previous 25% to 35% in 2030 (IEA, 2022c). The growth is set to be exponential ( Figure 14) with the share of electric cars in new registrations at 14% in 2022, an expected 18% in 2023 (IEA, 2023b). Past growth is in line with what is needed for 1.5°C in the sector (Boehm et al., 2023).\\\\nFigure 14 Share of electric in light-duty vehicles Electriﬁcation of vehicles (%) 0 20 40 60 80 100 2010 2040 Current trend Pace needed to reach targets 100% 2022 2023 2030 target 14% 18% 2035 target 95% 75% Historical data IEA projection Source: Boehm et al., 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 29 Other vehicles, such as buses and trucks, are also moving towards electrification albeit at a slower pace. In 2022 840 different battery electric buses and trucks were available in the market, which is dominated by China (60%), the USA (20%) and the EU (15%) and which seems to outpace hydrogen alternatives (IEA, 2023b). However, the shift to electric vehicles is not yet global but limited to advanced economies, mainly in the global North as well as China. In many countries the widespread adoption of electric vehicles still faces significant cost barriers, in particular in places where second hand markets dominate. Also, investment in charging infrastructure is lagging behind market developments. Beyond that, the necessary shift towards less car use, i.e., a reduction in the overall number of vehicles, is not yet happening across the board.\\\\nBATTERY STORAGE SAW SIGNIFICANT PRICE DECREASE AND IS NOW COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.\\\\nBattery storage technologies are critical for the renewable energy transition. They are needed as stationary solutions to solve the intermittency issues of variable renewable sources in the power and industry sector; mobile battery storage is of course critical for the electrification of the transport sector. For the latter the discussion on battery storage, costs and ranges has long been a major barrier for the wider uptake of electric vehicles.\\\\nIn the last decade, lithium-ion batteries, the dominant battery technology, have become commercially viable with a cost decline of 80% ( Figure 15). Battery prices are the main driver of EV costs and hence an important, if not the most important, factor for consumers. The recent price levels of batteries have pushed total cost of ownership to comparable levels with internal combustion engines (ICE).\\\\nNew developments in battery technology are expected to reduce costs even further. Alternatives could include solid-state batteries or sodium-ion batteries which have the advantage to rely on more widely available materials than lithium-ion based technologies. The development of new batteries is accelerated by policies in many parts of the world to incentivise investments into technology development and manufacturing capacity. In addition, concerns about supplies of important battery materials – including cobalt and lithium – are driving the search for alternatives (Crownhart, 2023).\\\\nWhilst the recent developments and trends are promising the availability of long-term storage remains a key barrier to the deep decarbonisation of the energy sector. In addition, environmental and human rights concerns associated with the sourcing of raw materials, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt, are critical issues yet to be solved.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 30 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement 2012 2022 Cost of batteries (USD/kWh) 0 800 400 2018 2016 2014 2020 cost decline 80% Figure 15 Cost of lithium-ion batteries between 2021 – 2022 Source: BloombergNEF, 2021; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nDEPLOYMENT OF HEAT PUMPS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR IS SOARING.\\\\nIn the building sector electrification has also been progressing with heat pumps as a key technology for the decarbonisation of heating demand. Globally, the sale of heat pumps saw double digit growth in 2021 and 2022 driven by increased policy support and incentives (IEA, 2023c) . Financial incentives for heat pumps are now available in over 30 countries which account for more than 70% of the current global heating demand (IEA, 2022a). Particularly in Europe sales of heat pumps have been soaring in the last decade with annual growth rates of 34% and 38% in 2021 and 2022 respectively ( Figure 16).\\\\nBeyond buildings, large-scale heat pumps are increasingly being tested for district heating systems (Energiewendebauen, 2023). Also, for industrial heat applications, in particular in the paper, food and chemicals industries, heat pumps are discussed as viable decarbonisation options (IEA, 2022b). About 50% of industry’s heat demand could already be electrified with existing low temperature heat technology, new electric high temperature heat technology is emerging (Kavanagh, 2022).\\\\nAt the same time the building as well as industry sectors are nowhere near alignment with the 1.5°C temperature goal and lagging far behind the energy supply sector. New building regulations in most parts of the world are not climate proof, and renovation rates of existing building stock is far too slow.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry NewClimate Institute November 2023 31 Figure 16 Sales of heat pumps in Europe 2013 – 2022 Sales of heat pumps (million) 0 1 2 3 2018 2019 2020 2021 2014 2015 2016 2017 2013 2022 +34% +38% +10% Source: Rosenow and Gibb, 2023; Re-produced by NewClimate Institute.\\\\nDEEP DECARBONISATION MOVING INTO FOCUS IN HARD TO ABATE INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORT SECTORS.\\\\nA decade ago full decarbonisation of the hard to abate industry sectors or international shipping and aviation was not under discussion. The common assumption was that other sectors would decarbonise first and that incremental emission reductions would suffice in the meantime. The picture now has changed completely. In the emission intensive industry sector, the need to go to zero carbon is now recognised by many and several companies are now working towards this. For example, the number of hydrogen steel plants has been increasing in recent years with currently 60 plants being planned worldwide (Green Steel Tracker, 2023).\\\\nNoteworthy are also advances in the shipping sector where all-electric cruise (Doll, 2022) and container ships (The Maritime Executive, 2023) are hitting the oceans and waterways. Some major shipping companies have committed to zero carbon fuels in the future (e.g., Maersk) likely to push the competition in a similar direction as regulation is tightening in the sector. Overall, decarbonisation solutions in the hard to abate sectors are still in their infancy and far from widespread adoption. Much more innovation for further electrification shifts is needed. The emissions impact of the fledgling climate action is not yet visible, and several sectors are lagging behind, including aviation, cement, chemicals and aluminium.\\\\nAwareness & civil action Visions, goals & policies Investors & businesses Energy supply Electrification & industry 32 Five major shifts since the Paris Agreement ” WELL, IN OUR COUNTRY,” SAID ALICE “YOU’D GENERALLY GET TO SOMEWHERE ELSE—IF YOU RUN VERY FAST FOR A LONG TIME, AS WE’VE BEEN DOING.” “A SLOW SORT OF COUNTRY!” SAID THE QUEEN. “NOW, HERE, YOU SEE, IT TAKES ALL THE RUNNING YOU CAN DO, TO KEEP IN THE SAME PLACE. IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU MUST RUN AT LEAST TWICE AS FAST AS THAT!” NewClimate Institute November 2023 33 CONCLUDING REMARKS We are not running alongside Alice in Wonderland but our climate policy environment seems to follow similar principles. During the last decade many things shifted in the right direction. In some areas shifts happened at a very fast pace (electric mobility), often faster than had been predicted (solar deployment). Some involved deeper systemic shifts (power systems) that cannot be reversed anymore, yet others are rather fledgling but still noticeable (industry). Overall, whilst progress is happening and solutions to avert the climate crisis are being implemented globally, the climate crisis itself is accelerating at an ever-faster pace, threatening to cancel out the progress made. So we need to run faster.\\\\nOn the positive side, the many shifts highlighted in the paper show that we can run fast, that change is possible and can happen unexpectedly, instigated by new actors (global youth), using new strategies (climate litigation) pushing governments and companies to act. All this gives hope that the Paris Agreement goal to keep global temperature increase to 1.5°C is still within reach. Temperature projections over the years underline this showing that under current policies temperature increase would reach 2.7°C. This is nowhere near where we need to be but at least a full degree lower than predictions a decade earlier.\\\\nNeedless to say, it is critical to reinforce current trends and accelerate climate action on all levels. Change needs to happen everywhere, at the same time and very fast, in some areas a great deal faster than seems realistic today. Digitalisation and new technologies can help but come with their own set of issues that we need to deal with. Arguments about trade-offs, in particular when it comes to broader sustainability issues, cannot and should not be used to slow down action, rather more innovation and deeper change is needed to find equitable and sustainable solutions. We need to think out of the box, think the impossible, find new alliances and get all society behind the cause. There will be systemic questions that need answering not least as many of the positive shifts we have seen are based on a growth paradigm which far exceeds planetary boundaries. Consumption patterns have started to change in some areas and consumers in wealthier (and younger) parts of society are shifting to more sustainable habits, however, unhealthy consumption patterns remain strong and are continued to be reinforced by our economic systems. There are many critical areas where shifts have not yet happened or have been reversed. Deforestation, biodiversity loss, societal equity and justice questions need urgent responses.

It is prudent to, as far as this is even possible, hedge against the risk of sliding into an intensifying climate crisis as we are moving dangerously close to climate tipping points. While the situation appears daunting and the high-level political agenda is not set for constructive cooperation, we can draw strength from the many positive developments. At the technical level cooperation is continuing, and globally our technical capacities and knowledge have been increasing. We know what to do and are ready to act where windows of opportunity arise and the geopolitical situation makes way. It is easy to feel disheartened about our current set of challenges but history has also shown that the future is not predictable and full of disruptive surprises.

Global landscape of renewable energy finance 2023\\\\n\\\\n#### Newsletter\\\\n\\\\nGo\\\\n\\\\nGlobal investment in energy transition technologies, including energy efficiency, reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022. However, annual investments need to at least quadruple to remain on track to achieve the 1.5°C Scenario in IRENA’s _[World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Mar/World-Energy-Transitions-Outlook-2023)_. Investment in renewable energy was also unprecedented – at USD 0.5 trillion – but represented less than one third of the average investment needed each year. Investments are also not flowing at the pace or scale needed to accelerate progress towards universal energy access; investments in off-grid renewable energy solutions in 2021 – at USD 0.5 billion – fell far short of the USD 2.3 billion needed annually in off-grid solar products alone (not including mini-grids).\\\\n\\\\nThis third edition of the biannual joint report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) analyses investment trends by technology, sector, region, source of finance and financial instrument in the period 2013-2020 and provides preliminary data for 2021-2022. It identifies financing gaps to support informed policy making for the deployment of renewables at the scale needed to accelerate the energy transition.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that investments have become further concentrated in specific technologies and uses, and in a small number of countries/regions. It underscores the need to direct public funds to regions and countries that have considerable untapped potential but find it difficult to attract investment. Funding must be focused on supporting energy transition infrastructure development, as well as enabling policy frameworks to drive investment and address persistent socio-economic gaps.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional analyses\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\n*   [### Global geothermal market and technology

For developing countries, the report identifies those targets that are conditional on financial assistance and determines the minimum level of financing needed to support their achievement. It also examines the extent to which renewable energy targets in NDCs are aligned with those set out in national plans and policies, and whether these are reflected in laws, policies or roadmaps and plans. The report finds that renewable energy ambitions within NDCs are not only insufficient, but also fall short of what countries have committed to in domestic policies that exist outside the framework of the Paris Agreement (national laws, policies, roadmaps, plans, strategies). As per IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway, and the COP28 pledge to triple renewable power globally, renewable power generation capacity in the G20 countries alone would need to grow from less than 3 terawatts (TW) in 2022 to 9.4 TW by 2030, accounting for 80% of the global total. The commitments made in NDCs account for less than half of that required to align with the tripling renewables pledge, and those made in national energy plans and policies fall short by 30%. The report also notes that developing countries – mainly least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) – plan to double their renewable installed capacity, compared to 2022, to more than 110 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. However, more than half of this is conditional on international support in the form of financing, technical assistance, technology transfer or capacity building.

\"The Paris Agreement | United Nations Skip to main content Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Laurent Fabius, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France and President of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21); and François Hollande, President of France celebrate after the historic adoption of Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris Agreement Climate change is a global emergency that goes beyond national borders. It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels. To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic Paris Agreement. The Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to: substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change periodically assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of this agreement and its long-term goals provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts. The Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. Today, 195\\xa0Parties (194 States\\xa0plus the European Union) have joined the Paris Agreement. The Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries’ climate goals. The Paris Agreement provides a durable framework guiding the global effort for decades to come. It marks the beginning of a shift towards a net-zero emissions world. Implementation of the Agreement is also essential for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. How does it work? The Paris Agreement works on a five- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries. Every five years, each country is expected to submit an updated national climate action plan - known as Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC. In their NDCs, countries communicate actions they will take to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries also communicate in the NDCs actions they will take to build resilience to adapt to the impacts of rising temperatures. In 2023, the first “global stocktake” of the world’s efforts under the Paris Agreement concluded at COP28 with a decision on how to accelerate action across all areas – mitigation, adaptation, and finance – by 2030, including a call on governments to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and solar power in their next round of climate commitments. To better frame the efforts towards the long-term goal, the Paris Agreement invites countries to formulate and submit long-term strategies. Unlike NDCs, they are not mandatory. The operational details for the practical implementation of the Paris Agreement were agreed on at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, in what is colloquially called the Paris Rulebook, and finalized at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021.

Read more Home > News > Investment Policies for the Energy Transition: Incentives and Disincentives Investment Policies for the Energy Transition: Incentives and Disincentives 21 Nov 2023 UNCTAD has just released a new edition of its Investment Policy Monitor on investment policies for the energy transition. This Monitor reviews and analyses policies related to some of the main incentives and disincentives to clean energy investment, expanding on the findings and analysis presented in the World Investment Report 2023: Investing in sustainable energy for all (WIR23) and further drawing from the insights and the discussion at UNCTAD\\'s 8th World Investment Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi from 16 to 20 October 2023. UNCTAD\\'s World Investment Report 2023 highlights a worrisome increase in the SDG investment gap, surpassing $4 trillion annually in developing countries alone, with energy investment needs estimated at $2.2 trillion per year. Successful energy transition necessitates significant investment in renewable energy projects, the phased decommissioning of fossil fuel assets and the promotion of cleaner power generation solutions. However, investing in renewables and clean energy is hindered by a range of specific risks and challenges, leading to higher costs of capital, especially in emerging and developing countries. Factors such as the natural resources endowment, the quality of the regulatory environment, market size and maturity, and economic and political uncertainty determine the unique potential and risk profile of each country. Policies and regulations play a pivotal role in both de-risking and incentivizing investment in the clean energy sector. The Monitor thus reviews and analyses 800 renewable energy policies around the world, identifying the key policy tools employed by countries in different regions and at varying levels of development to promote renewable investments. The Monitor’s findings reveal that existing policy frameworks aimed at promoting investment in the energy transition are notably inadequate, especially in poorer nations. Around the world, two-thirds of countries have adopted renewable energy policies. However, only half of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and one-third of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have done so. While developed and emerging economies have integrated private investment promotion mechanisms into over 70 per cent of their renewable energy policies, the same holds true for only 24 per cent of policies in LDCs and 17 percent of those in SIDS. While most developed economies use targeted investment promotion policies, many developing countries use generic tax incentives – applicable to investment in any industry – that do not address the specificities of energy investment projects. In recent times, auctions and tenders for renewable energy projects have gained traction across all country groups. The monitor also provides an overview of existing clean energy transition policies in technologies and fuels that would allow the decarbonization of the traditional power sector. While ultimately the policy objective is to phase out fossil fuels, thermal power plants will continue to play a role in ensuring energy security for many countries in the years to come. To curb their environmental impact, broader adoption of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, cofiring, and low-carbon fuels is key. At present, policies and initiatives to promote investment in such technologies are predominantly confined to developed countries and large emerging economies. Finally, this edition of the Investment Policy Monitor also highlights trends in the evolution of fossil fuel subsidies around the world, which represent a disincentive to the promotion of investment in clean energy. The value of fossil fuel subsidies has reached a staggering $1 trillion, far surpassing support for renewable energy. Gradually phasing out these subsidies, although complex for many countries, would incentivize investments in renewables.

Yet, behind this remarkable growth lies a critical enabler: government subsidies. From tax credits that make solar panels affordable for homeowners to grants that fund groundbreaking wind energy projects, subsidies act as a financial backbone, propelling nations toward ambitious climate goals. However, not all subsidy programs are created equal. Across continents, the approaches to incentivizing renewable energy vary widely, reflecting differences in economic priorities, resource availability, and political will. Some regions have mastered the art of balancing market dynamics with fiscal support, while others grapple with inefficiencies and challenges that stifle progress. This article delves into the diverse landscape of renewable energy subsidies worldwide, unraveling how these financial tools are shaping the global energy transition. By examining successes, challenges, and regional nuances, we aim to shed light on what works, what doesn’t, and what the future might hold for a subsidy-driven renewable energy revolution. What Are Renewable Energy Subsidies? Renewable energy subsidies are financial mechanisms designed to encourage the adoption and development of sustainable energy sources. These subsidies come in various forms, including tax credits, which reduce the tax liabilities of individuals or businesses investing in renewable energy systems; grants, which provide upfront funding for renewable projects; and feed-in tariffs, which guarantee fixed prices for energy producers who supply electricity from renewable sources to the grid. Other forms include loan guarantees, rebates, and performance-based incentives, each tailored to specific energy needs and market conditions. Governments provide these subsidies to address market barriers, such as high upfront costs of renewable technologies and competition from cheaper fossil fuels. By making green energy more economically viable, subsidies encourage innovation, attract private investment, and drive economies of scale. They also play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning national energy policies with international climate agreements like the Paris Accord. The importance of renewable energy subsidies cannot be overstated in the fight against climate change. By accelerating the transition to cleaner energy, these subsidies not only mitigate environmental risks but also promote energy security and create economic opportunities, particularly in emerging markets. Subsidy Frameworks in Different Continents North America In North America, subsidies play a pivotal role in renewable energy development. The United States has made significant strides with policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which allocates billions in tax credits for renewable energy projects and clean energy manufacturing. State-level initiatives further bolster these efforts, such as California’s solar rebate programs and Texas’s wind energy incentives. Similarly, Canada supports green energy through federal grants, tax credits, and research funding, emphasizing a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. Europe Europe’s commitment to renewable energy is anchored in the European Green Deal, a comprehensive policy package aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The EU employs a mix of subsidy mechanisms, including carbon pricing, which penalizes high emitters, and renewable energy auctions, where companies compete for contracts based on cost-effectiveness. These tools have propelled countries like Denmark and Spain into renewable energy leadership positions. Asia In Asia, subsidies reflect the continent’s diverse economic and environmental priorities. China, the world’s largest renewable energy investor, provides extensive subsidies for solar and wind projects, coupled with low-interest loans and tax incentives. India has adopted innovative schemes like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) for solar manufacturing, while Japan focuses on funding offshore wind projects. However, balancing subsidies with rapid economic growth remains a challenge for many Asian countries. Africa Africa faces unique challenges in implementing renewable energy subsidies due to limited financial resources and infrastructural gaps. However, there are success stories, such as South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), which has attracted significant private investment. This program demonstrates how targeted subsidies can catalyze green energy development, even in resource-constrained regions. South America South America, particularly Brazil, has emerged as a renewable energy leader, thanks to its abundant natural resources and robust subsidy frameworks.

This includes examining agreements like the Paris Agreement, government incentives, and subsidies. Sources may include government websites, international organizations (e.g., IRENA, IEA), and policy analysis reports.\",\\n    \"findings\": \"Here\\'s a comprehensive overview of the current international and national policies promoting renewable energy adoption, including key agreements, government incentives, and subsidies:\\\\n\\\\n### 1. **International Agreements**\\\\n#### **Paris Agreement**\\\\n- **Objective**: The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2\\\\u00b0C, with efforts to limit it to 1.5\\\\u00b0C. It requires countries to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that outline their climate action plans.\\\\n- **Recent Developments**: In 2023, the first global stocktake concluded at COP28, emphasizing the need for accelerated action towards renewable energy transitions, particularly away from fossil fuels. Countries are encouraged to enhance their commitments in future NDCs.\\\\n- **Financial Support**: The agreement includes provisions for developed nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries to help them mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. [More details here](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement).\\\\n\\\\n### 2. **National Policies and Incentives**\\\\n#### **G20 Financial Support**\\\\n- In 2023, G20 governments provided at least **USD 168 billion** in public financial support for renewable power, which is significantly less than fossil fuel subsidies. This support is primarily directed towards solar and wind energy projects.\\\\n- To meet the COP28 pledge of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, public financial support may need to double to around **USD 336 billion** annually. [Source: IISD](https://www.iisd.org/publications/report/renewable-energy-support-g20).\\\\n\\\\n#### **IRENA Report on NDCs**\\\\n- A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlights that current renewable energy ambitions in NDCs are insufficient. For G20 countries, renewable power generation capacity needs to grow from less than **3 terawatts (TW)** in 2022 to **9.4 TW** by 2030.\\\\n- Many developing countries plan to double their renewable capacity but require international support for over half of this growth. [Source: IRENA](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Dec/NDCs-and-renewable-energy-targets-in-2023-Tripling-renewable-power-by-2030).\\\\n\\\\n### 3. **Investment Policies**\\\\n#### **UNCTAD Investment Policy Monitor**\\\\n- The UNCTAD report emphasizes the need for significant investment in renewable energy, estimating that **$2.2 trillion** annually is required for energy transition in developing countries.\\\\n- It identifies that while two-thirds of countries have renewable energy policies, only a fraction of LDCs and SIDS have effective frameworks in place. The report also highlights the need to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which currently amount to **$1 trillion** globally. [Source: UNCTAD](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcbinf2023d8_en.pdf).\\\\n\\\\n### 4. **Regional Approaches to Subsidies**\\\\n#### **North America**\\\\n- The U.S. has implemented the **Inflation Reduction Act**, providing substantial tax credits for renewable energy projects. State-level initiatives also support solar and wind energy.\\\\n- Canada offers federal grants and tax credits to promote green energy, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050.\\\\n\\\\n#### **Europe**\\\\n- The **European Green Deal** aims for carbon neutrality by 2050, employing mechanisms like carbon pricing and renewable energy auctions to incentivize investment in renewables.\\\\n\\\\n#### **Asia**\\\\n- China leads in renewable energy investment, providing extensive subsidies for solar and wind projects. India has introduced innovative schemes like the **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI)** for solar manufacturing.\\\\n\\\\n#### **Africa**\\\\n- South Africa\\'s **Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP)** has successfully attracted private investment through targeted subsidies.\\\\n\\\\n#### **South America**\\\\n- Brazil has emerged as a leader in renewable energy, supported by robust subsidy frameworks for wind and bioenergy projects.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. **Challenges and Future Directions**\\\\n- Despite the progress, many countries still face challenges in implementing effective renewable energy policies. The need for a balanced approach that includes phasing out fossil fuel subsidies while promoting renewable investments is critical.\\\\n- The global investment landscape for renewable energy must quadruple to meet climate goals, highlighting the urgency for enhanced financial mechanisms and international cooperation.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\nThe landscape of renewable energy policies is evolving, with significant international commitments and national initiatives aimed at promoting clean energy adoption. However, achieving the ambitious targets set by agreements like the Paris Agreement requires sustained financial support, innovative policies, and a commitment to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies.\",\\n    \"timestamp\": \"2025-06-17T14:11:23.434743\"\\n  }\\n]', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_XVourOz1ktDPFJhhDbkaEo73', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"recent technological innovations in renewable energy solar wind battery storage 2023\"}'}}]}, {'content': '[{\"title\": \"Informing Energy Transitions: The 2023 Electricity Annual Technology ...\", \"url\": \"https://www.nrel.gov/manufacturing/news/program/2023/informing-energy-transitions-the-2023-electricity-annual-technology-baseline\", \"content\": \"Analysts from NREL, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management closely follow electricity generation and storage technologies included in the 2023 Electricity ATB: land-based wind, offshore wind, distributed wind, utility-scale solar photovoltaics (PV), commercial-scale solar PV, residential-scale solar PV, concentrating solar power, geothermal power, hydropower, [...] Significant changes in this year’s Electricity ATB include:\\\\n\\\\n   The addition of retrofit technologies for carbon capture and storage for coal and natural gas plants \\\\n   Introduction of four representative wind turbine technologies to show variation in design by wind class \\\\n   New learning curves for enhanced geothermal systems\\\\n   Photovoltaic capacity factors that consider bifaciality\\\\n   New financial assumptions that include a simplified representation of the IRA tax credits.

A number of authoritative organizations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) as indicated in Fig. 1, have made recent predictions that renewable energy sources are more likely to become mainstream internationally in the near future.\\\\n\\\\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that renewable energy production will surge 58% by 2023, with an output of 18,900 terawatt-hours (TWh). Renewable energy\\'s growth reflects not only a growing awareness of its environmental benefits, but also an increasing shift towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources aligned with environmental stewardship and sustainable development principles. In addition, IRENA\\'s forecasts illustrate an optimistic outlook for the future, with non-fossil sources of energy projected to account for 57% of global energy production by 2030 [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. International agreements like the Paris Agreement have overarching objectives that are aligned with these projections. Global warming is subject to limits under the Paris Agreement aiming to limit it to well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as well as 1.5° Celsius. In order to mitigate climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy, such ambitious targets highlight the urgency of collective action. To meet these gaps and maintain a balance between electricity production and demand, energy storage systems (ESSs) are considered to be the most practical and efficient solutions. ESSs are designed to convert and store electrical energy from various sales and recovery needs [[11], [12], [13]]. ESSs are a multi-volume entity in scope, with different authors addressing different positions from different perspectives [14,15]. ESS are critical for the seamless integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, as they address the intermittency and variability inherent in sources such as solar and wind. Among the technologies considered, pumped hydroelectric storage systems demonstrate the most promising efficiency based on energy density vs power density, as shown in Fig. 2.\\\\n\\\\nPumped hydroelectric storage stands out from the other technologies depicted due to its exceptional energy density. Its ability to store massive amounts of energy per unit volume or mass makes it an ideal candidate for large-scale energy storage applications. The graph shows that pumped hydroelectric storage exceeds other storage systems in terms of energy and power density. This demonstrates its potential as a strong and efficient solution for storing an excess renewable energy, allowing for a consistent supply of clean electricity to meet grid demands.\\\\n\\\\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of ESSs, based on their development, configuration, current status, and applications. While reviews have focused on electrical or thermal storage properties [[16], [17], [18]], this review attempts to bring together all the important ESSs. This review presents their details based on the historical development of ESSs, their configuration, and various communication technologies. This review provides a brief and high-level overview of the current state of ESSs through a value for new student research, which will provide a useful reference for forum-based research and innovation in the field. The literature reviews the state-of-the-art storage technologies, emphasizing their various applications, including the essential residential integration within the electricity grid, considering the current state of the art. It fully integrates various energy storage technologies, which include lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium‑sulfur, and vanadium-redox flow batteries, as well as mechanical, hydrogen, and thermal energy storage systems [[19], [20], [21]]. In reviewing the recent advancements in energy storage technologies, we also compiled a comprehensive table (Table 1) summarizing various studies and their focus, findings, and novelty in different systems of energy storage showing the importance of ongoing research in this field. In addition, the navigation character faces drawbacks that prevent the widespread use of these technologies, such as the uncertainty and gaps of updating information data and the absence of unique numbers. The authors claim that a comprehensive assessment of existing technologies that combines economic and environmental aspects is necessary to make safe decisions. Several investigations have considered the technical and economic aspects of storage, but there is a lack of information on their environmental impact. The review indicates the absence of knowledge space identification in the area of energy storage, which requires updating and accumulating data. The authors suggest that future research should focus on utility-scale planning for different energy storage technologies based on different energy use power and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cost estimates. As various ESSs are deployed, fossil fuel-based generation is displaced, and inefficient peaker plants are minimized, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions in renewable energy systems. Additionally, ESSs facilitate the integration of distributed energy sources like solar panels on rooftops and electric vehicles, therefore enhancing grid resilience and energy security. Due to the complexity and challenges associated with the integration of renewable energy and energy storage technologies, this review article provides a comprehensive assessment of progress, challenges, and applications in the field of energy storage in order to fill critical gaps in the existing literature. This paper provides a novel perspective on the state of energy storage technology by synthesizing data from reputable sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) with our own original analysis and insights. In this paper, we identify key challenges and limitations faced by existing energy storage technologies and propose potential solutions and directions for future research and development in order to clarify the role of energy storage systems (ESSs) in enabling seamless integration of renewable energy into the grid. By advancing renewable energy and energy storage technologies, this research ultimately aims to contribute to a sustainable and reliable energy future where climate change can be mitigated and energy security is assured.\\\\n\\\\nSection snippets\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nClassification of energy storage technologies\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nEnergy storage technologies can be classified according to storage duration, response time, and performance objective.

Firstly, a regional multi-energy system with shared energy storage is constructed, and the Power Sharing (PS) and Capacity Sharing (CS) game pricing modes are designed based on different sharing modes. Secondly, to reduce the influence of the uncertainty of wind and solar output on the configuration model, a random optimization method is used to generate a large number of scenarios and reduce them to obtain the required scenarios. Then, based on the master-slave game pricing strategy, a stochastic optimized configuration model with Shared Energy Storage Operators (SESO) as the leader and REPP as the follower is established to maximize the net profit of each subject. The optimal energy storage service price and optimal configuration are solved by the two-party game. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed configuration method can increase the revenue of both sides, reduce the amount of energy storage configuration, and cope well with the uncertainty of renewable energy output. Compared with CS, the net income of REPP under PS is 10.60% higher, and the total net income of REPP is 2.71% higher. The energy storage return cycle under CS is shortened by nearly two years.    \\\\n*   ### [A modified white shark optimizer for optimizing photovoltaic, wind turbines, biomass, and hydrogen storage hybrid systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25003688)\\\\n\\\\n2025, Journal of Energy Storage  Show abstract Recently, the focus has shifted to using renewable energy resources through off-grid solutions to provide electricity in isolated regions rather than traditional approaches. This paper investigates different configurations for optimal sizing of off-grid hybrid renewable systems, made up of photovoltaic (PV), biomass system (BGS), wind turbines (WT), and hydrogen storage (HS) unit with the intention of reducing the project energy cost (EC), excess energy (EE), and meeting the reliability index, such as the probability of power supply loss (PPSL). This paper focused on satisfying the energy demand of a small health center, and the suggested implementation region for this case study is the desert road of the New Qena area in the Qena Governorate, Egypt. The stochastic sizing of the recommended hybrid system is executed utilizing a novel modified White shark optimizer called mWSO. The proposed mWSO utilizes two improvement techniques: quasi-dynamic opposite learning (QDOL) and Weibull probability distribution (WPD) to enhance the efficiency of the original WSO method. The effectiveness of the new mWSO approach is verified through a comprehensive performance evaluation using cec2022 benchmark function and comparing its results with the original WSO as well as other known optimization approaches using different statistical parameters. After verifying the superiority of the proposed mWSO algorithm, it is employed to find the ideal configuration for four different scenarios of the proposed system (PV/WT/BGS/HS, PV/BGS/HS, PV/WT/HS, and WT/BGS/HS). The outcomes of the proposed mWSO showed superior performance compared to the remaining optimizers used, such as the original WSO, Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO), Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO), and Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) to achieve the lowest EC and reducing the total net present cost of the project (TNPC) in all scenarios of the proposed system.    \\\\n*   ### [A green ammonia and solar-driven multi-generation system: Thermo-economic model and optimization considering molten salt thermal energy storage, fuel cell vehicles, and power-to-gas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890424011671)\\\\n\\\\n2025, Energy Conversion and Management  Show abstract In this paper, an ammonia-fueled combined heat and power generation system is modeled and analyzed from thermodynamic and economic points of view for application in large industrial sectors. Moreover, solar parabolic trough collectors and molten salt thermal energy storage are used to preheat water entering a bottoming steam-driven power generation cycle. An electrolizer is installed to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen for charging a hydrogen storage tank, procuring hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, and producing methane by combining hydrogen and captured carbo dioxide. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is solved to supply the natural gas, heat and electrical demands of a steel industry while minimizing the cost of the electrical power purchased from the local distribution grid during two extremely-hot summer days. It is found that ammonia-solar fueled poly-generation system is not only applicable for industrial sectors with maximum 10 MW electricity, 14 MW heat, and 11 MW natural gas demands under at least 52% energy efficiency, but also supplies hydrogen for transportation electrification using fuel cell vehicles. The total cost of the electrical power purchased from the upstream distribution company during 48-h study horizon is obtained as 300 $, which proves the economic feasibility of the proposed gas-energy nexus model.    \\\\n*   ### [Solar-driven Pt free hydrogen production and successive degradation of sulfasalazine using CuO/ZnO binary nanocomposites: Reaction kinetics and determination of reaction parameters using response surface methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876107024004474)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers  Show abstract Approaches for sustainable, green, and expensive catalyst-free hydrogen production have not been explored extensively. Moreover, during photocatalysis, a lot of material gets wasted due to a lack of proper optimization of the reaction parameters to remove the toxic industrial effluents. Here in this study, we present the green synthesis of CuO/ZnO nanocomposites from the ethanolic crude extract of _Oxystelma esculentum_. The synthesized photocomposites were systematically characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The performed analyses provided useful insights into identifying important functional groups, size, morphology, elemental composition, crystallinity, and defects in the synthesized photocomposites. After characterization, the nanocomposites were evaluated for photocatalytic sulfasalazine (SSZ) degradation and hydrogen production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize SSZ\\'s photocatalytic degradation. The optimized values of reaction parameters for the photocatalytic degradation of SSZ comprise pH = 4.06, SSZ dose = 47.75 mg/L, CuO/ZnO dose = 44.42 mg, and temperature = 23.60 °C. The rates observed in the hydrogen production (1136 µmolh-1 g-1) were obtained without costly co-catalyst. The optimized values for hydrogen production include photocatalyst dosage = 50 mg, pH = 7, and time = 5 hours. These features signify the efficient separation of charge carriers between synthesized nanocomposites, resulting in exquisite activities.    \\\\n*   ### [Enabling industrial decarbonization: Framework for hydrogen integration in the industrial energy systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032124005082)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews Citation Excerpt : \\\\nEnergy storage technologies play a vital role in energy systems by balancing supply and demand, thereby enhancing grid stability. Moreover, they support the broader adoption of renewable energy sources [3]. Energy storage technologies can be categorized into mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical types.   Show abstract For sustainable industrial growth, it is essential to reduce the energy intensity of production through technological advancements while ensuring cleaner energy sources are available to meet electricity and heat requirements. At the same time, hydrogen holds potential in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries as a clean fuel. This review aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating hydrogen energy to decarbonize industries effectively. It begins with an overview of energy storage technologies, followed by a discussion of hydrogen applications in the industry. A life-cycle assessment of green hydrogen highlights its environmental benefits. The review also provides a systematic analysis of energy system models, leading to the introduction of a framework for hydrogen integration in energy systems. The objective is to demonstrate how hydrogen, supported by renewable energy sources, can serve as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in carbon-intensive sectors. The proposed framework considers four aspects: understanding the current industrial process, evaluating hydrogen\\'s applicability, building a mathematical model to simulate the integrated system, and analyzing the model\\'s findings in terms of energy consumption, environmental impact, and economic feasibility. By following these steps, industries and policymakers can make informed decisions about integrating hydrogen for a more sustainable future, setting a precedent for similar economic sectors.    \\\\n*   ### [Insights into Novel Doping Effect of Fe-Doped ZnS Nanostructures Derived from Oxystelma esculentum: Kinetics-Based Photocatalysis, Nitrogen Fixation, and Antifungal Efficacy](https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14120888)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Catalysts     \\\\n\\\\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85194043257&md5=308aecf6af493bed84823421ec44384)\\\\n\\\\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X24016980#bfn0005)\\\\n\\\\nAuthors equally contributed to this work.\\\\n\\\\n[View full text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X24016980)\\\\n\\\\n© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Executive Summary In this work we describe the development of cost and performance projections for utility-scale lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on 4-hour duration systems. The projections are developed from an analysis of recent publications that include utility-scale storage costs. The suite of publications demonstrates wide variation in projected cost reductions for battery storage over time. Figure ES-1 shows the suite of projected cost reductions (on a normalized basis) collected from the literature (shown in gray) as well as the low, mid, and high cost projections developed in this work (shown in black). Figure ES-2 shows the overall capital cost for a 4-hour battery system based on those projections, with storage costs of $245/kWh, $326/kWh, and $403/kWh in 2030 and $159/kWh, $226/kWh, and $348/kWh in 2050. Battery variable operations and maintenance costs, lifetimes, and efficiencies are also discussed, with recommended values selected based on the publications surveyed. Figure ES-1.

In 2016, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a set of cost projections for utility-scale lithium-ion batteries (Cole et al. 2016). Those 2016 projections relied heavily on electric vehicle battery projections because utility-scale battery projections were largely unavailable for durations longer than 30 minutes. In 2019, battery cost projections were updated based on publications that focused on utility-scale battery systems (Cole and Frazier 2019), with updates published in 2020 (Cole and Frazier 2020) and 2021 (Cole, Frazier, and Augustine 2021). There was no update published in 2022. This report updates those cost projections with data published in 2021, 2022, and early 2023. The projections in this work focus on utility-scale lithium-ion battery systems for use in capacity expansion models. These projections form the inputs for battery storage in the Annual Technology Baseline (NREL 2022). The projections are then utilized in NREL’s capacity expansion models, including the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) (Ho et al. 2021) and the Resource Planning Model (RPM) (Mai et al. 2013). 2 Methods The cost and performance projections developed in this work use a literature-based approach in which projections are generally based on the low, median, and highest values from the literature. Table 1 lists the publications that are presented in this work. Because of rapid price changes and deployment expectations for battery storage, only the publications released in 2022 and 2023 are used to create the projections. In addition to the publications in Table 1, we also include a 2020 report by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI 2020) for operations and maintenance (O&M) and performance assumptions, but we do not use their cost projection because it was published before 2022. There are a number of challenges inherent in developing cost and performance projections based on published values. First among those is that the definition of the published values is not always clear. For example, dollar year, online year, duration, depth-of-discharge, lifetime, and O&M are not always defined in the same way (or even defined at all) for a given set of values. As such, some of the values presented here required interpretation from the sources specified. Second, many of the published values compare their published projection against projections produced by others, and it is unclear how much the projections rely upon one-another. Thus, if one projection is used to inform another, that projection might artificially bias our results (toward that particular projection) more than others. Third, because of the relatively limited dataset for actual battery systems and the rapidly changing costs, it is not clear how different battery projections should be weighted. For example, should projections published in the latter half of 2022 be given higher weight than those published earlier? Or are some organizations better at making projections or capturing supply chain disruptions, and therefore should be given higher weight? In the interest of providing a neutral survey of the current literature, all cost projections included in this report are weighted equally. As we performed our review of published projections, we found that many of them cited either the previous updates of this report, or they cited the Annual Technology Baseline, which also relies on this cost projection report for its inputs. Thus, 2 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. including all of the latest published projections would create known redundancies (per the second challenge listed above) and were therefore excluded from this work. In some cases, our previous work was provided as a starting point for projections, and then adjustments were made to better capture analysts’ view of battery storage pricing. If that was the case, we considered the projection unique and included it in our survey. Table 1. List of publications used in this study to determine battery cost and performance projections. In several cases consultants were involved in creating the storage cost projections. In these instances we list the consulting firm first, followed by the organization they are supporting.

We only used projections for 4-hour lithium-ion storage systems. We define the 4-hour duration as the output duration of the battery, such that a 4-hour device would be able to discharge at rated power capacity for 4-hours. In practice that would mean that the device would charge for more than 4 hours and would nominally hold more than its rated energy capacity in order to compensate for losses during charge and discharge. We report our price projections as a total system overnight capital cost expressed in units of $/kWh. However, not all components of the battery system cost scale directly with the energy capacity (i.e., kWh) of the system (Ramasamy et al. 2022). For example, the inverter costs scale according to the power capacity (i.e., kW) of the system, and some cost components such as the developer costs can scale with both power and energy. By expressing battery costs in $/kWh, we are deviating from other power generation technologies such as combustion turbines or solar photovoltaic plants where capital costs are usually expressed as $/kW. We use the units of $/kWh because that is the most common way that battery system costs have been expressed in published material to date. The $/kWh costs we report can be converted to $/kW costs simply by multiplying by the duration (e.g., a $300/kWh, 4-hour battery would have a power capacity cost of $1200/kW). To develop cost projections, storage costs were normalized to their 2022 value such that each projection started with a value of 1 in 2022. We chose to use normalized costs rather than absolute costs because systems were not always clearly defined in the publications. For example, it is not clear if a system is more expensive because it is more efficient and has a longer lifetime, or if the authors simply anticipate higher system costs. With the normalized method, many of the differences matter to a lesser degree. We defined our low, mid, and high projections as the minimum, median, and maximum point, respectively in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2030. The minimum and median points were also defined in the same way because the minimum and median projections extended through 2050. The maximum projection in 2030 did not extend through 2050. One projection showed only a 5.8% cost decline from 2030 to 2050, so we used this as the basis for extending the highest cost 2030 projection through to 2050. In other words, the highest cost projection in 2030 was assumed to decline by 5.8% through 2050. Points in between 2025, 2030, and 2050 were set based on linear interpolation between years with values assigned. To convert these normalized low, mid, and high projections into cost values, the normalized values were multiplied by the 4-hour battery storage cost from Ramasamy et al. (2022) to produce 4-hour battery systems costs. To estimate the costs for other storage durations (i.e., durations other than 4 hours), we assign separate energy costs and power costs such that Total Cost ($/kWh) = Energy Cost ($/kWh) + Power Cost ($/kW) / Duration (hr) To separate the total cost into energy and power components, we used the relative energy and power costs from Augustine and Blair (2021). These relative shares are projected through 2050, enabling an approach for calculating the cost for any duration of energy storage. Because we 4 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. focus primarily on multi-hour battery configurations, we caution against using this approach to calculate battery storage costs with less than one hour duration. The method employed in this work relies solely on literature projections. It does not take into account other factors that might impact costs over time, such as materials availability, market size, and policy factors. Unless these and other factors are not captured in the work surveyed, then they will not be reflected in the projection produced here. 3 Results and Discussion The normalized cost trajectories with the low, mid, and high projections are shown in Figure 1. The high projection follows the highest cost trajectory through 2030. This includes cost increases through 2025, with costs only being lower than the 2022 costs starting in 2026. After 2030, the high projection declines by 5.8% as described in the methods section. The mid and low projections have initial slopes being steeper than later slopes, indicating that most publications see larger cost reductions in the near-term that then slow over time. By 2030, costs are reduced by 47%, 32%, and 16% in the low, mid, and high cases, respectively, and by 2050 are reduced by 67%, 51%, and 21%, respectively. Figure 1. Battery cost projections for 4-hour lithium-ion systems, with values relative to 2022. The high, mid, and low cost projections developed in this work are shown as bolded lines. Published projections are shown as gray lines. Figure values are included in the Appendix. The resulting total system cost for a 4-hour battery storage device is shown in Figure 2. The 2022 starting point of $482/kWh is taken from Ramasamy et al. (2022). Although there is uncertainty in the 2022 cost (which is discussed later), we use a single cost for 2022 for convenience as we apply these costs in our long-term planning models (applying the same costs in 2022 means that the 2022 solution will not change as we shift from a “high” to a “mid” to a “low” cost projection for storage). By definition, the projections follow the same trajectories as the normalized cost values. Storage costs are $255/kWh, $326/kWh, and $403/kWh in 2030 and $159/kWh, $237/kWh, and $380/kWh in 2050.

Figure 2. Battery cost projections for 4-hour lithium-ion systems. These values represent overnight capital costs for the complete battery system. Figure values are included in the Appendix. One of the key assumptions in our projections is the choice of the starting point. A higher or lower starting point would shift the set of projections up or down relative to the change in magnitude of the starting point. To better assess the quality of our starting point, we compared the value from NREL’s cost estimate from Ramasamy et al. (2022) with other recently published values (shown in Figure 3). This comparison shows that our starting point is on the high end but generally within the range of estimated current pricing. This higher starting point is the single largest driver for why this year’s cost projections are higher than those previously published. Figure 3. Current battery storage costs from recent studies. The NREL value (Ramasamy et al. 2022) was selected as the 2022 starting cost for this work. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 4-hour Battery Capital Cost (2022$/kWh) High Mid Low 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Current 4-hour battery cost (2022$/kWh) 6 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. One of the other challenges with using the normalized cost reductions to develop our projections is that projections that start at a higher value than our starting point might see greater cost reduction potential, and thus have a high percent reduction but still never have a low $/kWh cost. Conversely, projections that start lower than our starting point might have smaller cost reduction potential on a percentage basis but achieve very low $/kWh costs. However, we still prefer to use the normalized cost reduction numbers because of the large discrepancy in starting costs across published projections, and because it helps to obviate the challenge of different cost and system definitions in the different publications. Figure 4 shows the cost projections for the power and energy components of the battery. These components are combined to give a total system cost, where the system cost (in $/kWh) is the power component divided by the duration plus the energy component. Figure 4. Cost projections for energy (left) and power (right) components of 4-hour lithium-ion systems. Note the different units in the two plots. These power and energy costs can be used to specify the capital costs for other durations. Figure 5 shows the cost projections for 2-, 4-, and 6-hour duration batteries (using the mid projection only). On a $/kWh basis, longer duration batteries have a lower capital cost, and on a $/kW basis, shorter duration batteries have a lower capital cost. Figure 5 (left) also demonstrates why it is critical to cite the duration whenever providing a capital cost in $/kWh or $/kW. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2020 2030 2040 2050 Cost of Energy Components (2022$/kWh) High Low Mid 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2020 2030 2040 2050 Cost of Power Components (2022$/kW) Low High Mid 7 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. Figure 5. Cost projections for 2-, 4-, and 6-hour duration batteries using the mid cost projection. Left shows the values in $/kWh, while right shows the costs in $/kW. To fully specify the cost and performance of a battery storage system for capacity expansion modeling tools, additional parameters besides the capital costs are needed. Figure 6 shows the range of variable operations and maintenance (VOM), fixed operations and maintenance (FOM), lifetime, and round-trip efficiency1 assumptions from the publications surveyed. The rightmost point in the figure shows the value that we have selected to represent our 4-hour battery system. The VOM is often taken to be zero or near zero, and we have adopted zero for the VOM. This VOM is defined to coincide with an assumed one cycle per day and a given calendar lifetime. The three publications showing non-zero, but still small, VOM values indicate that there is not consensus that the VOM should be zero. We have allocated all operating costs (at the one-cycle-per-day level) to the FOM. By putting the operations and maintenance costs in the FOM rather than the VOM we in essence assume that battery performance has been guaranteed over the lifetime, such that operating the battery does not incur any costs to the battery operator. The FOM has a much broader range of values. One of the primary differences in the level of FOM was whether augmentation or performance maintenance were included in the cost. Lower FOM numbers typically include only simple maintenance while higher FOM numbers include some capacity additions or replacements to address degradation. We have adopted a FOM value from the high end and assume that the FOM cost will counteract degradation such that the system will be able to perform at rated capacity throughout its lifetime.2 The FOM value selected is 2.5% of the $/kW capacity cost for a 4-hour battery. We assume that this FOM is consistent with providing approximately one cycle per day. 1 Round-trip efficiency is defined as the system efficiency through a charge/discharge cycle. For example, it would include losses associated with cooling systems or battery control equipment. 2 The Brattle publication (Newell et al. 2022) performs a detailed analysis of the operations and maintenance costs needed to keep the battery at rated capacity throughout its lifetime, and their reported cost is well-aligned with the value we have chosen. However, Brattle also assumed a lower storage cost than what we assume here, but has a similar total FOM cost, so based on their analysis an even higher FOM value for our projection might be justified. 4-hour 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2020 2030 2040 2050 Battery Capital Cost (2022$/kWh) 2-hour 6-hour 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 2020 2030 2040 2050 Battery Capital Cost (2020$/kW) 2-hour 4-hour 6-hour 8 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.

The values selected for this study are the right-most values shown. The lifetime we selected is 15 years, which is consistent with the median of the published values. The round-trip efficiency is chosen to be 85%, which is well aligned with published values. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 4-hr Battery VOM (2022$/MWh) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 4-hr Battery FOM (2022$/kW-yr) 0 5 10 15 20 25 Lifetime (years) 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% 100% Round-trip Efficiency 9 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. 4 Summary Battery storage costs have evolved rapidly over the past several years, necessitating an update to storage cost projections used in long-term planning models and other activities. This work documents the development of these projections, which are based on recent publications of storage costs. The projections show a wide range of storage costs, both in terms of current costs as well as future costs. In the near term, some projections show increasing costs while others show substantial declines, with cost reductions by 2025 of -3% to 36%. The cost projections developed in this work utilize the normalized cost reductions across the literature, and result in 16-49% capital cost reductions by 2030 and 28-67% cost reductions by 2050. The cost projections are also accompanied by assumed operations and maintenance costs, lifetimes, and round-trip efficiencies, and these performance metrics are benchmarked against other published values. Many factors might influence how costs evolve going forward including market demand, supply chain expansions or constraints, interplay with other sectors such electric vehicles, and material costs and availability.\\\\n10 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Appendix Table 2 includes the values that are plotted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show the comparison of the projections developed in this work relative to the projections that were produced in our last update (Cole, Frazier, and Augustine 2021). The 4-hour cost projections in this report are much higher in 2022 due to the updated initial cost from Ramasamy et al. (2022), and higher costs persist through 2050 because of that higher starting point. Higher normalized cost projections in this year’s update also contribute to the higher costs throughout the projection horizon. This year’s update is also the first to see increasing costs in the near term. 13 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Increasing reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources has wrought severe damage on our planet, leading to alarming pollution levels, accelerated depletion of natural resources, and the worsening of climate change. In light of these challenges, it is imperative that energy production and consumption patterns undergo a paradigm shift. Renewable energies offer clean, sustainable, greenhouse gas-free alternatives that address these pressing concerns [[1], [2], [3]]. By harnessing natural processes and phenomena, renewable energy sources reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels, such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and biomass. Creating a sustainable world through renewable energy stands to be a major milestone in addressing global climate change and achieving environmental sustainability [[4], [5], [6]]. A number of authoritative organizations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) as indicated in Fig. 1, have made recent predictions that renewable energy sources are more likely to become mainstream internationally in the near future.\\\\n\\\\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that renewable energy production will surge 58% by 2023, with an output of 18,900 terawatt-hours (TWh). Renewable energy\\'s growth reflects not only a growing awareness of its environmental benefits, but also an increasing shift towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources aligned with environmental stewardship and sustainable development principles. In addition, IRENA\\'s forecasts illustrate an optimistic outlook for the future, with non-fossil sources of energy projected to account for 57% of global energy production by 2030 [[7], [8], [9], [10]]. International agreements like the Paris Agreement have overarching objectives that are aligned with these projections. Global warming is subject to limits under the Paris Agreement aiming to limit it to well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as well as 1.5° Celsius. In order to mitigate climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy, such ambitious targets highlight the urgency of collective action. To meet these gaps and maintain a balance between electricity production and demand, energy storage systems (ESSs) are considered to be the most practical and efficient solutions. ESSs are designed to convert and store electrical energy from various sales and recovery needs [[11], [12], [13]]. ESSs are a multi-volume entity in scope, with different authors addressing different positions from different perspectives [14,15]. ESS are critical for the seamless integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, as they address the intermittency and variability inherent in sources such as solar and wind. Among the technologies considered, pumped hydroelectric storage systems demonstrate the most promising efficiency based on energy density vs power density, as shown in Fig. 2.\\\\n\\\\nPumped hydroelectric storage stands out from the other technologies depicted due to its exceptional energy density. Its ability to store massive amounts of energy per unit volume or mass makes it an ideal candidate for large-scale energy storage applications. The graph shows that pumped hydroelectric storage exceeds other storage systems in terms of energy and power density. This demonstrates its potential as a strong and efficient solution for storing an excess renewable energy, allowing for a consistent supply of clean electricity to meet grid demands.\\\\n\\\\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of ESSs, based on their development, configuration, current status, and applications. While reviews have focused on electrical or thermal storage properties [[16], [17], [18]], this review attempts to bring together all the important ESSs. This review presents their details based on the historical development of ESSs, their configuration, and various communication technologies. This review provides a brief and high-level overview of the current state of ESSs through a value for new student research, which will provide a useful reference for forum-based research and innovation in the field. The literature reviews the state-of-the-art storage technologies, emphasizing their various applications, including the essential residential integration within the electricity grid, considering the current state of the art. It fully integrates various energy storage technologies, which include lithium-ion, lead-acid, sodium‑sulfur, and vanadium-redox flow batteries, as well as mechanical, hydrogen, and thermal energy storage systems [[19], [20], [21]]. In reviewing the recent advancements in energy storage technologies, we also compiled a comprehensive table (Table 1) summarizing various studies and their focus, findings, and novelty in different systems of energy storage showing the importance of ongoing research in this field. In addition, the navigation character faces drawbacks that prevent the widespread use of these technologies, such as the uncertainty and gaps of updating information data and the absence of unique numbers. The authors claim that a comprehensive assessment of existing technologies that combines economic and environmental aspects is necessary to make safe decisions. Several investigations have considered the technical and economic aspects of storage, but there is a lack of information on their environmental impact. The review indicates the absence of knowledge space identification in the area of energy storage, which requires updating and accumulating data. The authors suggest that future research should focus on utility-scale planning for different energy storage technologies based on different energy use power and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cost estimates. As various ESSs are deployed, fossil fuel-based generation is displaced, and inefficient peaker plants are minimized, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions in renewable energy systems. Additionally, ESSs facilitate the integration of distributed energy sources like solar panels on rooftops and electric vehicles, therefore enhancing grid resilience and energy security. Due to the complexity and challenges associated with the integration of renewable energy and energy storage technologies, this review article provides a comprehensive assessment of progress, challenges, and applications in the field of energy storage in order to fill critical gaps in the existing literature. This paper provides a novel perspective on the state of energy storage technology by synthesizing data from reputable sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) with our own original analysis and insights. In this paper, we identify key challenges and limitations faced by existing energy storage technologies and propose potential solutions and directions for future research and development in order to clarify the role of energy storage systems (ESSs) in enabling seamless integration of renewable energy into the grid. By advancing renewable energy and energy storage technologies, this research ultimately aims to contribute to a sustainable and reliable energy future where climate change can be mitigated and energy security is assured.\\\\n\\\\nSection snippets\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nClassification of energy storage technologies\\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nEnergy storage technologies can be classified according to storage duration, response time, and performance objective. However, the most commonly used ESSs are divided into mechanical, chemical, electrical, and thermochemical energy storage systems according to the form of energy stored in the reservoir (Fig. 3) [[48], [49], [50], [51]]. Energy storage devices have been demanded in grids to increase energy efficiency. According to the report of the United States Department of Energy (USDOE),\\\\n\\\\nChronological development and significance with practical application\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThere are some energy storage technologies that have emerged as particularly promising in the rapidly evolving landscape of energy storage technologies due to their exceptional capabilities and versatility in dealing with diverse energy storage needs as shown by Fig. 14.

Firstly, a regional multi-energy system with shared energy storage is constructed, and the Power Sharing (PS) and Capacity Sharing (CS) game pricing modes are designed based on different sharing modes. Secondly, to reduce the influence of the uncertainty of wind and solar output on the configuration model, a random optimization method is used to generate a large number of scenarios and reduce them to obtain the required scenarios. Then, based on the master-slave game pricing strategy, a stochastic optimized configuration model with Shared Energy Storage Operators (SESO) as the leader and REPP as the follower is established to maximize the net profit of each subject. The optimal energy storage service price and optimal configuration are solved by the two-party game. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed configuration method can increase the revenue of both sides, reduce the amount of energy storage configuration, and cope well with the uncertainty of renewable energy output. Compared with CS, the net income of REPP under PS is 10.60% higher, and the total net income of REPP is 2.71% higher. The energy storage return cycle under CS is shortened by nearly two years.    \\\\n*   ### [A modified white shark optimizer for optimizing photovoltaic, wind turbines, biomass, and hydrogen storage hybrid systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25003688)\\\\n\\\\n2025, Journal of Energy Storage  Show abstract Recently, the focus has shifted to using renewable energy resources through off-grid solutions to provide electricity in isolated regions rather than traditional approaches. This paper investigates different configurations for optimal sizing of off-grid hybrid renewable systems, made up of photovoltaic (PV), biomass system (BGS), wind turbines (WT), and hydrogen storage (HS) unit with the intention of reducing the project energy cost (EC), excess energy (EE), and meeting the reliability index, such as the probability of power supply loss (PPSL). This paper focused on satisfying the energy demand of a small health center, and the suggested implementation region for this case study is the desert road of the New Qena area in the Qena Governorate, Egypt. The stochastic sizing of the recommended hybrid system is executed utilizing a novel modified White shark optimizer called mWSO. The proposed mWSO utilizes two improvement techniques: quasi-dynamic opposite learning (QDOL) and Weibull probability distribution (WPD) to enhance the efficiency of the original WSO method. The effectiveness of the new mWSO approach is verified through a comprehensive performance evaluation using cec2022 benchmark function and comparing its results with the original WSO as well as other known optimization approaches using different statistical parameters. After verifying the superiority of the proposed mWSO algorithm, it is employed to find the ideal configuration for four different scenarios of the proposed system (PV/WT/BGS/HS, PV/BGS/HS, PV/WT/HS, and WT/BGS/HS). The outcomes of the proposed mWSO showed superior performance compared to the remaining optimizers used, such as the original WSO, Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO), Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO), and Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) to achieve the lowest EC and reducing the total net present cost of the project (TNPC) in all scenarios of the proposed system.    \\\\n*   ### [A green ammonia and solar-driven multi-generation system: Thermo-economic model and optimization considering molten salt thermal energy storage, fuel cell vehicles, and power-to-gas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890424011671)\\\\n\\\\n2025, Energy Conversion and Management  Show abstract In this paper, an ammonia-fueled combined heat and power generation system is modeled and analyzed from thermodynamic and economic points of view for application in large industrial sectors. Moreover, solar parabolic trough collectors and molten salt thermal energy storage are used to preheat water entering a bottoming steam-driven power generation cycle. An electrolizer is installed to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen for charging a hydrogen storage tank, procuring hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, and producing methane by combining hydrogen and captured carbo dioxide. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is solved to supply the natural gas, heat and electrical demands of a steel industry while minimizing the cost of the electrical power purchased from the local distribution grid during two extremely-hot summer days. It is found that ammonia-solar fueled poly-generation system is not only applicable for industrial sectors with maximum 10 MW electricity, 14 MW heat, and 11 MW natural gas demands under at least 52% energy efficiency, but also supplies hydrogen for transportation electrification using fuel cell vehicles. The total cost of the electrical power purchased from the upstream distribution company during 48-h study horizon is obtained as 300 $, which proves the economic feasibility of the proposed gas-energy nexus model.    \\\\n*   ### [Solar-driven Pt free hydrogen production and successive degradation of sulfasalazine using CuO/ZnO binary nanocomposites: Reaction kinetics and determination of reaction parameters using response surface methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876107024004474)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers  Show abstract Approaches for sustainable, green, and expensive catalyst-free hydrogen production have not been explored extensively. Moreover, during photocatalysis, a lot of material gets wasted due to a lack of proper optimization of the reaction parameters to remove the toxic industrial effluents. Here in this study, we present the green synthesis of CuO/ZnO nanocomposites from the ethanolic crude extract of _Oxystelma esculentum_. The synthesized photocomposites were systematically characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The performed analyses provided useful insights into identifying important functional groups, size, morphology, elemental composition, crystallinity, and defects in the synthesized photocomposites. After characterization, the nanocomposites were evaluated for photocatalytic sulfasalazine (SSZ) degradation and hydrogen production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize SSZ\\'s photocatalytic degradation. The optimized values of reaction parameters for the photocatalytic degradation of SSZ comprise pH = 4.06, SSZ dose = 47.75 mg/L, CuO/ZnO dose = 44.42 mg, and temperature = 23.60 °C. The rates observed in the hydrogen production (1136 µmolh-1 g-1) were obtained without costly co-catalyst. The optimized values for hydrogen production include photocatalyst dosage = 50 mg, pH = 7, and time = 5 hours. These features signify the efficient separation of charge carriers between synthesized nanocomposites, resulting in exquisite activities.    \\\\n*   ### [Enabling industrial decarbonization: Framework for hydrogen integration in the industrial energy systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032124005082)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews Citation Excerpt : \\\\nEnergy storage technologies play a vital role in energy systems by balancing supply and demand, thereby enhancing grid stability. Moreover, they support the broader adoption of renewable energy sources [3]. Energy storage technologies can be categorized into mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical types.   Show abstract For sustainable industrial growth, it is essential to reduce the energy intensity of production through technological advancements while ensuring cleaner energy sources are available to meet electricity and heat requirements. At the same time, hydrogen holds potential in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries as a clean fuel. This review aims to develop a comprehensive framework for integrating hydrogen energy to decarbonize industries effectively. It begins with an overview of energy storage technologies, followed by a discussion of hydrogen applications in the industry. A life-cycle assessment of green hydrogen highlights its environmental benefits. The review also provides a systematic analysis of energy system models, leading to the introduction of a framework for hydrogen integration in energy systems. The objective is to demonstrate how hydrogen, supported by renewable energy sources, can serve as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in carbon-intensive sectors. The proposed framework considers four aspects: understanding the current industrial process, evaluating hydrogen\\'s applicability, building a mathematical model to simulate the integrated system, and analyzing the model\\'s findings in terms of energy consumption, environmental impact, and economic feasibility. By following these steps, industries and policymakers can make informed decisions about integrating hydrogen for a more sustainable future, setting a precedent for similar economic sectors.    \\\\n*   ### [Insights into Novel Doping Effect of Fe-Doped ZnS Nanostructures Derived from Oxystelma esculentum: Kinetics-Based Photocatalysis, Nitrogen Fixation, and Antifungal Efficacy](https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14120888)\\\\n\\\\n2024, Catalysts     \\\\n\\\\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85194043257&md5=308aecf6af493bed84823421ec44384)\\\\n\\\\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X24016980#bfn0005)\\\\n\\\\nAuthors equally contributed to this work.\\\\n\\\\n[View full text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X24016980)\\\\n\\\\n© 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

With renewables already fueling over [30%](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2024/global-overview) of global electricity in 2024, that future isn’t far off. By 2025, renewable electricity is expected to surpass coal as the world’s leading energy source, marking a turning point in the fight against climate change.\\\\n\\\\nBut this transformation isn’t limited to electricity grids. Green hydrogen is carving a niche in heavy industry and transport, while bioenergy and advanced technologies are reshaping homes and businesses. With policy backing and rapid innovation, renewables are transforming global energy. Here’s what’s driving the change.\\\\n\\\\n**Download our latest**[**2025 Trends: Renewable Energy & Solar Research Report**](https://to.ratedpower.com/ebooks/solar-research-report/)**to unlock essential insights on the renewables industry. With perspectives from an industry-wide survey and stats from solar simulations on the RatedPower platform, it’s your go-to resource for understanding trends, challenges, and design strategies for the year to come.**\\\\n\\\\n**Top 10 key innovations in renewable energy**\\\\n----------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n### **1. Perovskite solar cells**\\\\n\\\\nPerovskite solar cells are transforming solar power with dramatic efficiency gains and affordability. These cells have advanced from 3% efficiency in 2009 to [over 25%](https://www.powerengineeringint.com/solar/a-promising-future-for-perovskite-solar-cells/) today, rivaling traditional silicon panels. Tandem solar cells that combine perovskite and silicon layers further boost efficiency to [above 30%](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/perovskite-solar-cells), surpassing the limits of silicon alone.\\\\n\\\\nDespite their promise, stability remains a challenge.

Executive Summary In this work we describe the development of cost and performance projections for utility-scale lithium-ion battery systems, with a focus on 4-hour duration systems. The projections are developed from an analysis of recent publications that include utility-scale storage costs. The suite of publications demonstrates wide variation in projected cost reductions for battery storage over time. Figure ES-1 shows the suite of projected cost reductions (on a normalized basis) collected from the literature (shown in gray) as well as the low, mid, and high cost projections developed in this work (shown in black). Figure ES-2 shows the overall capital cost for a 4-hour battery system based on those projections, with storage costs of $245/kWh, $326/kWh, and $403/kWh in 2030 and $159/kWh, $226/kWh, and $348/kWh in 2050. Battery variable operations and maintenance costs, lifetimes, and efficiencies are also discussed, with recommended values selected based on the publications surveyed. Figure ES-1.

In 2016, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a set of cost projections for utility-scale lithium-ion batteries (Cole et al. 2016). Those 2016 projections relied heavily on electric vehicle battery projections because utility-scale battery projections were largely unavailable for durations longer than 30 minutes. In 2019, battery cost projections were updated based on publications that focused on utility-scale battery systems (Cole and Frazier 2019), with updates published in 2020 (Cole and Frazier 2020) and 2021 (Cole, Frazier, and Augustine 2021). There was no update published in 2022. This report updates those cost projections with data published in 2021, 2022, and early 2023. The projections in this work focus on utility-scale lithium-ion battery systems for use in capacity expansion models. These projections form the inputs for battery storage in the Annual Technology Baseline (NREL 2022). The projections are then utilized in NREL’s capacity expansion models, including the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) (Ho et al. 2021) and the Resource Planning Model (RPM) (Mai et al. 2013). 2 Methods The cost and performance projections developed in this work use a literature-based approach in which projections are generally based on the low, median, and highest values from the literature. Table 1 lists the publications that are presented in this work. Because of rapid price changes and deployment expectations for battery storage, only the publications released in 2022 and 2023 are used to create the projections. In addition to the publications in Table 1, we also include a 2020 report by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI 2020) for operations and maintenance (O&M) and performance assumptions, but we do not use their cost projection because it was published before 2022. There are a number of challenges inherent in developing cost and performance projections based on published values. First among those is that the definition of the published values is not always clear. For example, dollar year, online year, duration, depth-of-discharge, lifetime, and O&M are not always defined in the same way (or even defined at all) for a given set of values. As such, some of the values presented here required interpretation from the sources specified. Second, many of the published values compare their published projection against projections produced by others, and it is unclear how much the projections rely upon one-another. Thus, if one projection is used to inform another, that projection might artificially bias our results (toward that particular projection) more than others. Third, because of the relatively limited dataset for actual battery systems and the rapidly changing costs, it is not clear how different battery projections should be weighted. For example, should projections published in the latter half of 2022 be given higher weight than those published earlier? Or are some organizations better at making projections or capturing supply chain disruptions, and therefore should be given higher weight? In the interest of providing a neutral survey of the current literature, all cost projections included in this report are weighted equally. As we performed our review of published projections, we found that many of them cited either the previous updates of this report, or they cited the Annual Technology Baseline, which also relies on this cost projection report for its inputs. Thus, 2 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. including all of the latest published projections would create known redundancies (per the second challenge listed above) and were therefore excluded from this work. In some cases, our previous work was provided as a starting point for projections, and then adjustments were made to better capture analysts’ view of battery storage pricing. If that was the case, we considered the projection unique and included it in our survey. Table 1. List of publications used in this study to determine battery cost and performance projections. In several cases consultants were involved in creating the storage cost projections. In these instances we list the consulting firm first, followed by the organization they are supporting.

If no inflation rate was found in the document, we found used the inflation rate assumed in other recent documents produced by the same organization. 3 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. We only used projections for 4-hour lithium-ion storage systems. We define the 4-hour duration as the output duration of the battery, such that a 4-hour device would be able to discharge at rated power capacity for 4-hours. In practice that would mean that the device would charge for more than 4 hours and would nominally hold more than its rated energy capacity in order to compensate for losses during charge and discharge. We report our price projections as a total system overnight capital cost expressed in units of $/kWh. However, not all components of the battery system cost scale directly with the energy capacity (i.e., kWh) of the system (Ramasamy et al. 2022). For example, the inverter costs scale according to the power capacity (i.e., kW) of the system, and some cost components such as the developer costs can scale with both power and energy. By expressing battery costs in $/kWh, we are deviating from other power generation technologies such as combustion turbines or solar photovoltaic plants where capital costs are usually expressed as $/kW. We use the units of $/kWh because that is the most common way that battery system costs have been expressed in published material to date. The $/kWh costs we report can be converted to $/kW costs simply by multiplying by the duration (e.g., a $300/kWh, 4-hour battery would have a power capacity cost of $1200/kW). To develop cost projections, storage costs were normalized to their 2022 value such that each projection started with a value of 1 in 2022. We chose to use normalized costs rather than absolute costs because systems were not always clearly defined in the publications. For example, it is not clear if a system is more expensive because it is more efficient and has a longer lifetime, or if the authors simply anticipate higher system costs. With the normalized method, many of the differences matter to a lesser degree. We defined our low, mid, and high projections as the minimum, median, and maximum point, respectively in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2030. The minimum and median points were also defined in the same way because the minimum and median projections extended through 2050. The maximum projection in 2030 did not extend through 2050. One projection showed only a 5.8% cost decline from 2030 to 2050, so we used this as the basis for extending the highest cost 2030 projection through to 2050. In other words, the highest cost projection in 2030 was assumed to decline by 5.8% through 2050. Points in between 2025, 2030, and 2050 were set based on linear interpolation between years with values assigned. To convert these normalized low, mid, and high projections into cost values, the normalized values were multiplied by the 4-hour battery storage cost from Ramasamy et al. (2022) to produce 4-hour battery systems costs. To estimate the costs for other storage durations (i.e., durations other than 4 hours), we assign separate energy costs and power costs such that Total Cost ($/kWh) = Energy Cost ($/kWh) + Power Cost ($/kW) / Duration (hr) To separate the total cost into energy and power components, we used the relative energy and power costs from Augustine and Blair (2021). These relative shares are projected through 2050, enabling an approach for calculating the cost for any duration of energy storage. Because we 4 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. focus primarily on multi-hour battery configurations, we caution against using this approach to calculate battery storage costs with less than one hour duration. The method employed in this work relies solely on literature projections. It does not take into account other factors that might impact costs over time, such as materials availability, market size, and policy factors. Unless these and other factors are not captured in the work surveyed, then they will not be reflected in the projection produced here. 3 Results and Discussion The normalized cost trajectories with the low, mid, and high projections are shown in Figure 1. The high projection follows the highest cost trajectory through 2030. This includes cost increases through 2025, with costs only being lower than the 2022 costs starting in 2026. After 2030, the high projection declines by 5.8% as described in the methods section. The mid and low projections have initial slopes being steeper than later slopes, indicating that most publications see larger cost reductions in the near-term that then slow over time. By 2030, costs are reduced by 47%, 32%, and 16% in the low, mid, and high cases, respectively, and by 2050 are reduced by 67%, 51%, and 21%, respectively. Figure 1. Battery cost projections for 4-hour lithium-ion systems, with values relative to 2022. The high, mid, and low cost projections developed in this work are shown as bolded lines. Published projections are shown as gray lines. Figure values are included in the Appendix. The resulting total system cost for a 4-hour battery storage device is shown in Figure 2. The 2022 starting point of $482/kWh is taken from Ramasamy et al. (2022). Although there is uncertainty in the 2022 cost (which is discussed later), we use a single cost for 2022 for convenience as we apply these costs in our long-term planning models (applying the same costs in 2022 means that the 2022 solution will not change as we shift from a “high” to a “mid” to a “low” cost projection for storage). By definition, the projections follow the same trajectories as the normalized cost values. Storage costs are $255/kWh, $326/kWh, and $403/kWh in 2030 and $159/kWh, $237/kWh, and $380/kWh in 2050.

Figure 2. Battery cost projections for 4-hour lithium-ion systems. These values represent overnight capital costs for the complete battery system. Figure values are included in the Appendix. One of the key assumptions in our projections is the choice of the starting point. A higher or lower starting point would shift the set of projections up or down relative to the change in magnitude of the starting point. To better assess the quality of our starting point, we compared the value from NREL’s cost estimate from Ramasamy et al. (2022) with other recently published values (shown in Figure 3). This comparison shows that our starting point is on the high end but generally within the range of estimated current pricing. This higher starting point is the single largest driver for why this year’s cost projections are higher than those previously published. Figure 3. Current battery storage costs from recent studies. The NREL value (Ramasamy et al. 2022) was selected as the 2022 starting cost for this work. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 4-hour Battery Capital Cost (2022$/kWh) High Mid Low 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Current 4-hour battery cost (2022$/kWh) 6 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. One of the other challenges with using the normalized cost reductions to develop our projections is that projections that start at a higher value than our starting point might see greater cost reduction potential, and thus have a high percent reduction but still never have a low $/kWh cost. Conversely, projections that start lower than our starting point might have smaller cost reduction potential on a percentage basis but achieve very low $/kWh costs. However, we still prefer to use the normalized cost reduction numbers because of the large discrepancy in starting costs across published projections, and because it helps to obviate the challenge of different cost and system definitions in the different publications. Figure 4 shows the cost projections for the power and energy components of the battery. These components are combined to give a total system cost, where the system cost (in $/kWh) is the power component divided by the duration plus the energy component. Figure 4. Cost projections for energy (left) and power (right) components of 4-hour lithium-ion systems. Note the different units in the two plots. These power and energy costs can be used to specify the capital costs for other durations. Figure 5 shows the cost projections for 2-, 4-, and 6-hour duration batteries (using the mid projection only). On a $/kWh basis, longer duration batteries have a lower capital cost, and on a $/kW basis, shorter duration batteries have a lower capital cost. Figure 5 (left) also demonstrates why it is critical to cite the duration whenever providing a capital cost in $/kWh or $/kW. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2020 2030 2040 2050 Cost of Energy Components (2022$/kWh) High Low Mid 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2020 2030 2040 2050 Cost of Power Components (2022$/kW) Low High Mid 7 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. Figure 5. Cost projections for 2-, 4-, and 6-hour duration batteries using the mid cost projection. Left shows the values in $/kWh, while right shows the costs in $/kW. To fully specify the cost and performance of a battery storage system for capacity expansion modeling tools, additional parameters besides the capital costs are needed. Figure 6 shows the range of variable operations and maintenance (VOM), fixed operations and maintenance (FOM), lifetime, and round-trip efficiency1 assumptions from the publications surveyed. The rightmost point in the figure shows the value that we have selected to represent our 4-hour battery system. The VOM is often taken to be zero or near zero, and we have adopted zero for the VOM. This VOM is defined to coincide with an assumed one cycle per day and a given calendar lifetime. The three publications showing non-zero, but still small, VOM values indicate that there is not consensus that the VOM should be zero. We have allocated all operating costs (at the one-cycle-per-day level) to the FOM. By putting the operations and maintenance costs in the FOM rather than the VOM we in essence assume that battery performance has been guaranteed over the lifetime, such that operating the battery does not incur any costs to the battery operator. The FOM has a much broader range of values. One of the primary differences in the level of FOM was whether augmentation or performance maintenance were included in the cost. Lower FOM numbers typically include only simple maintenance while higher FOM numbers include some capacity additions or replacements to address degradation. We have adopted a FOM value from the high end and assume that the FOM cost will counteract degradation such that the system will be able to perform at rated capacity throughout its lifetime.2 The FOM value selected is 2.5% of the $/kW capacity cost for a 4-hour battery. We assume that this FOM is consistent with providing approximately one cycle per day. 1 Round-trip efficiency is defined as the system efficiency through a charge/discharge cycle. For example, it would include losses associated with cooling systems or battery control equipment. 2 The Brattle publication (Newell et al. 2022) performs a detailed analysis of the operations and maintenance costs needed to keep the battery at rated capacity throughout its lifetime, and their reported cost is well-aligned with the value we have chosen. However, Brattle also assumed a lower storage cost than what we assume here, but has a similar total FOM cost, so based on their analysis an even higher FOM value for our projection might be justified. 4-hour 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 2020 2030 2040 2050 Battery Capital Cost (2022$/kWh) 2-hour 6-hour 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 2020 2030 2040 2050 Battery Capital Cost (2020$/kW) 2-hour 4-hour 6-hour 8 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.

This work documents the development of these projections, which are based on recent publications of storage costs. The projections show a wide range of storage costs, both in terms of current costs as well as future costs. In the near term, some projections show increasing costs while others show substantial declines, with cost reductions by 2025 of -3% to 36%. The cost projections developed in this work utilize the normalized cost reductions across the literature, and result in 16-49% capital cost reductions by 2030 and 28-67% cost reductions by 2050. The cost projections are also accompanied by assumed operations and maintenance costs, lifetimes, and round-trip efficiencies, and these performance metrics are benchmarked against other published values. Many factors might influence how costs evolve going forward including market demand, supply chain expansions or constraints, interplay with other sectors such electric vehicles, and material costs and availability.\\\\n10 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications.

In 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, while its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Globally, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide. Achieving the COP28 target of tripling global renewable capacity by 2030 hinges on policy implementation Prior to the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai, the International Energy Agency (IEA) urged governments to support five pillars for action by 2030, among them the goal of tripling global renewable power capacity. Several of the IEA priorities were reflected in the Global Stocktake text agreed by the 198\\xa0governments at COP28, including the goals of tripling renewables and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030. Tripling global renewable capacity in the power sector from 2022 levels by 2030 would take it above 11 000 GW, in line with IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario. Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7\\xa0300\\xa0GW by 2028. This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5\\xa0times its current level by 2030, falling short of the tripling goal. Governments can close the gap to reach over 11\\xa0000\\xa0GW by 2030 by overcoming current challenges and implementing existing policies more quickly. These challenges fall into four main categories and differ by country: 1)\\xa0policy uncertainties and delayed policy responses to the new macroeconomic environment; 2)\\xa0insufficient investment in grid infrastructure preventing faster expansion of renewables; 3)\\xa0cumbersome administrative barriers and permitting procedures and social acceptance issues; 4)\\xa0insufficient financing in emerging and developing economies. This report’s accelerated case shows that addressing those challenges can lead to almost 21% higher growth of renewables, pushing the world towards being on track to meet the global tripling pledge. What is needed to reach the collective target to triple renewables by 2030 varies significantly by country and region. G20\\xa0countries account for almost 90% of global renewable power capacity today. In the accelerated case, which assumes enhanced implementation of existing policies and targets, the G20 could triple their collective installed capacity by 2030. As such, they have the potential to contribute significantly to tripling renewables globally. However, to achieve the global goal, the rate of new installations needs to accelerate in other countries, too, including many emerging and developing economies outside the G20, some of which do not have renewable targets and/or supportive policies today. The global power mix will be transformed by 2028 The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the next five years than has been installed since the first commercial renewable energy power plant was built more than 100\\xa0years ago. In the main case forecast in this report, almost 3\\xa0700\\xa0GW of new renewable capacity comes online over the 2023‑2028 period, driven by supportive policies in more than 130\\xa0countries. Solar PV and wind will account for 95% of global renewable expansion, benefiting from lower ...\", \"status\": \"success\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_3q8Qak3RJytSf24ruwWghalm'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'description': 'A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results.

This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.\\\\n\\\\nThe torch is now being carried by solar, which is soon to overtake oil production said IEA. Almost 90% of new power generation\\xa0investments are now tied to solar and other low-carbon technologies, said the report.\\\\n\\\\nAbout $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, $1.7 trillion of which will go to clean technologies, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation. The remaining roughly $1 trillion is expected to be invested in fossil fuels. Annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023, driven by renewables and electric vehicles, compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.\\\\n\\\\nNearly $700 billion of investment is expected for renewable energy generation. Solar is the star performer with more than $1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023. IEA expects solar investment to total $380 billion for the year as a whole, edging this spending\\xa0above upstream oil for the first time.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with wholesale move toward clean generation is a global shift toward electrification. Global heat pump sales are growing at double-digit annual growth rates since 2021, and electric vehicles are expected to leap one-third this year after already undergoing a landmark year of growth in 2021.\\\\n\\\\nChina is expected to continue as the global frontrunner in clean energy investment, with increased spending of over $170 billion. The nation is followed by the European Union, with about $150 billion in increased investment, and the United States, adding about $100 billion in increased investment. Costs for clean energy edged higher in 2022, but pressures are easing in 2023, and mature clean technologies remain very cost-competitive in today’s fuel-price environment, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nChina alone added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity in 2022, almost 70% higher than in 2021, and annual installations increased by 40% or more in Europe, India and Brazil, despite inflation and supply chain issues.\\\\n\\\\n“While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable,” said the report. “Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend.”\\\\n\\\\nThis investment is gaining momentum due to a powerful alignment of costs, climate, and energy security goals and industrial strategies. The recovery from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to the global energy crisis have provided a significant boost to clean energy investment, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nWhile clean technology investments are rising worldwide, work needs to be done, especially in developing economies, said IEA. Many nations are being held back by higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks and market designs, weak grid infrastructure, financially strained utilities, and a high cost of capital. However, IEA notes that dynamic investments in solar in India, Brazil, and the Middle East are driving forward these markets.\\\\n\\\\nTo help address some of the above-listed headwinds, the IEA release a new report entitled *Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies* on June 22.\\\\n\\\\nFossil fuel producers made record profits in 2022, though much of this cash flow has gone to dividends, share buybacks, and debt repayment, rather than reinvestment back into traditional supply. IEA said that while a shift to renewables is underway, fossil fuels are expected to continue to drive growth – with oil and gas spending expected to rise 7% this year. Coal demand still remains high in some markets, and the shift from these assets may not be occurring fast enough, as coal investment is pacing to be six times above what IEA envisions for its 2030 Net Zero Scenario.\\\\n\\\\nIEA notes that clean energy among major oil and gas producers is continuing to rise, with solar and wind holding a similar share. Clean energy investment by these fossil fuels companies doubled in 2022 to about $20 billion. This investment represents about 4% of upstream capital and 0.5% of net income. European oil majors are outpacing U.S. oil majors considerably in this category, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, demand to adopt solar is strong. In its 2023 [Solar Snapshot](https://resources.aurorasolar.com/solar-industry-snapshot/) report, Aurora Solar reported that 45% of solar professionals reported increased demand as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, with another 40% expecting to see increased demand soon, and 70% noted their business grew in size. Nearly 77% of homeowners either have solar or are interested in purchasing it, said Aurora Solar.\\\\n\\\\nIn its 2021 World Energy Outlook report, IEA noted that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. This year, it said, “this picture is starting to change: global energy investment is picking up, and the rise in clean energy investment since 2021 is leading the way, outpacing the increase in fossil fuel investment by almost three to-one.”\\\\n\\\\n“If [clean energy investment] continues to grow at the rate seen since 2021, then aggregate spending in 2030 on low-emission power, grids and storage, and end-use electrification would exceed the levels required to meet the world’s announced climate pledges. For some technologies, notably solar, [investment] would match the investment required to get on track for a 1.5°C stabilization in global average temperatures,” said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

In 2023, the U.S. saw market growth both in more mature clean energy technologies and in previously slow-growing, emerging decarbonization solutions.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 2: 1a-Clean-tech Manufacturing](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1a-Clean-tech-Manufacturing.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Top market responses to the IRA tracked by the Factbook include:\\\\n\\\\n*   **PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT:** A record-shattering $303.3 billion in energy transition financing was deployed in the U.S. in 2023 for clean energy technologies, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, power grid investment and others.\\\\n*   **MANUFACTURING:** By the end of 2023, the number of manufacturing facilities planned across North America in response to the IRA rose to 104, representing $123 billion in announced investments. Battery and solar facilities dominate, with 34 facilities planned in each sector.\\\\n*   **RENEWABLE ENERGY:** 42 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power-generating capacity was added to the U.S. grid, driven mainly by robust solar additions.\\\\n*   **ENERGY STORAGE:** 7.5 GW of battery storage capacity was commissioned in the U.S. in 2023, a new record for the country. The U.S. is the second largest market globally for energy storage demand.\\\\n*   **ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS):** EV sales in the U.S. surged 50 percent to nearly 1.46 million vehicles sold. The surge was driven by new EV incentives, price cuts and more EV models released.\\\\n*   **CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS):** New investments in CCS totaled $2.8 billion, up 68 percent from 2022. Around 137 million metric tons annually (Mtpa) of new CCS projects are being planned in the U.S., against an installed base of 23 Mtpa in 2023.\\\\n*   **HYDROGEN:** Investments in hydrogen-producing projects totaled $1.9 billion in 2023, up 82 percent from 2022. A record 437 megawatts of new electrolyzers were shipped to the U.S., a 680 percent year-on-year increase.\\\\n*   **RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG):** U.S. RNG production capacity grew 13 percent in 2023. States that have passed or proposed “green gas” tariffs to enable utilities to use RNG include AR, CA, CO, IA, ID, IL, KS, MA, MI, NC, NE, NH, NJ, NY, OK, OR, PA, UT, VA, VT and WA.\\\\n*   **SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF):** Supply of renewable diesel and jet fuel, also known as SAF, rose 53 percent and 81 percent respectively in 2023. Globally, airlines signed a total of 36 agreements to procure SAF from January to early December. U.S.-based airlines led in procurement, likely due to government incentives such as investment tax credits under the IRA for SAF producers.\\\\n\\\\n**Global investment in the energy transition once again shattered records in 2023, soaring to $1.7 trillion, with the U.S. attracting $303 billion of investment, second to China’s $676 billion.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 3: 1b-Clean-Energy-Investment-2](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1b-Clean-Energy-Investment-2.png)\\\\n\\\\n**The U.S. – and North America in general – offers industrial customers some of the least-cost electricity in the world,** averaging 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2022 (latest data available).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 4: 1c-Industrial Power Prices](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1c-Industrial-Power-Prices.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nThe remarkable performance of clean energy markets in 2023, despite serious market headwinds, demonstrates the important role of federal policies to provide stability and a framework to guide industry growth. Despite higher interest rates and supply chain difficulties, as well as challenges presented by interconnection queues and lengthy permitting processes, the clean energy transition found a way to thrive in 2023 and continue its upward trajectory.\\\\n\\\\nBCSE believes that IRA-led investments are securing America’s economic competitiveness and leadership position in the global market.

A drop in hydropower and wind output was offset by strong solar generation.\\\\n*   Among renewable technologies, the 153 GW wind power fleet produced 428 TWh of electricity in 2023, followed by hydropower with 239 TWh and solar generating projects (utility-scale and rooftop solar) with 237 TWh.\\\\n*   Zero-carbon power (renewable energy generation plus nuclear power) accounted for an all-time high of 41.1 percent of U.S. electricity output in 2023.\\\\n*   Coal-fired generation fell to an all-time low of 15.8 percent of total U.S. power generation.\\\\n\\\\n### A CLOSER LOOK AT ELECTRICTY CAPACITY BUILD IN 2023\\\\n\\\\n*   An estimated 40.5 GW of new utility-scale power generation and storage capacity was commissioned in 2023 – the most in 20 years. Renewable energy was the dominant source, adding 24.1 GW of capacity in 2023. New natural gas-fired power generation capacity rose to 9 GW. Energy storage set a record for the fourth year in a row with 6.2 GW added.\\\\n*   2023 also marked the first year new nuclear power capacity was brought online since 2016.\\\\n*   Total U.S. renewable energy capacity, excluding pumped hydropower facilities, reached 425 GW in 2023. Despite lingering concerns about supply chains, high interest rates, and trade policy worries, the installed fleet of wind and solar capacity grew 13.5 percent for the year.\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nAs the share of U.S. electricity provided by natural gas and renewable energy continued to climb in 2023, the U.S. economy grew while greenhouse gas emissions decreased. This portfolio of low- and zero-carbon resources also offers the flexibility needed to manage the electricity grid.\\\\n\\\\nAs the U.S. energy economy has transformed over time to embrace cleaner resources and become more energy efficient, the energy costs of U.S. consumers have remained relatively low and stable. In 2023, energy spending accounted for 4.2 percent of total U.S. personal consumption expenditures, down 0.6 percentage points from 2022, as the cost of gasoline fell, along with slight drops in the price of natural gas and electricity.\\\\n\\\\nThe benefits of the energy transition, however, are not necessarily equally distributed across the diversity of U.S. communities and regions. Importantly, the Inflation Reduction Act includes provisions that focus investment and aim to lower costs in underserved and low-income communities.\\\\n\\\\n**U.S. energy productivity increased by 3.8 percent in 2023,** as the economy expanded 2.4 percent and U.S. primary energy consumption slowed by 1.4 percent. U.S. energy productivity has grown 30.6 percent over the past decade and has improved 101 percent since 1990.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6: 2b-EnergyProductivity](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2b-EnergyProductivity.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nEnergy productivity – a measure of economic output per unit of energy consumed in the U.S. – is an essential metric to grade our country’s competitiveness in the global market. The three-decade-long upward trajectory of U.S. energy productivity showcases the positive return on public and private sector investments in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is an essential tool in the toolbox needed to meet U.S. decarbonization goals.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n=\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions returned to a much-needed downward trajectory, falling 1.8%,**and led by reductions in the power sector. The U.S. also experienced the highest number of extreme weather events on record.\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: 3a - Greenhouse Emissions Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3a-GreenhouseEmissions-1.png)\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, the U.S. experienced 28 climate-related disasters, the highest number recorded, causing $92.9 billion in damages.** Nineteen of these were severe storms that accounted for 58 percent of total financial damages. Since 2012, roughly 2.8 GW of microgrids, 5,000 megawatt-hours of energy storage, have been brought online. Microgrids are powered by solar, energy storage and diesel generation sets.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 8: Weather Disasters in 2023](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3b-WeatherDisasters-1.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nU.S. emissions in 2023 were at their lowest levels since 1987, with 2020 the exception due to COVID-19 lockdowns. Emissions fell across all sectors except for transport. Progress remains concentrated in the power sector, which accounted for 83 percent of the overall drop in 2023. The bulk of emission reductions in the power sector to-date can be attributed to coal being displaced by natural gas.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough it is a good sign that U.S. emissions have returned to their downward trajectory, the pace of reductions is not where it needs to be if the U.S. is to meet its current goal under the Paris Agreement to reduce economy-wide emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In 2023, U.S. emissions were down 16 percent over 2005 levels.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) in the United Arab Emirates, countries agreed to double the average rate of energy efficiency improvements worldwide by 2030, triple the capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030, and begin the transition away from fossil fuel energy systems, with the aim of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The call for accelerated pacing of the global energy transition has near-universal support, and the United States has the technology solutions that are needed.\\\\n\\\\nClimate-related disasters place undue strains on public coffers and community well-being. The U.S. energy system is critical infrastructure that needs immediate attention to avoid the negative consequences of extreme weather and natural disasters.\\\\n\\\\nWhat We Are Watching\\\\n====================\\\\n\\\\n### **U.S. energy infrastructure needs reform of regulatory timelines and processes.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9: Average Project Wait Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4a-AverageProjectWait.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Take Away\\\\n\\\\nAs of January 2024, more than 1,100 GW of projects were undergoing interconnection studies in the seven U.S. independent system operators.\\\\n\\\\n### Dive In\\\\n\\\\nLearn more on Factbook page 50.\\\\n\\\\n### **The U.S. has emerged as a global leader in power sector digitalization.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 10: Digital Partnerships Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4b-DigitalPartnerships.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Take Away\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. accounted for 40 percent, or 81 out of 206, of the total digital projects and partnerships in the global power sector in 2023.

This number is a new record level of annual investment and demonstrates the resilience of the clean energy transition in a year of geopolitical turbulence, high interest rates and cost inflation.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that electrified transport is now the largest sector for spending in the energy transition, growing 36% in 2023 to $634 billion. This figure includes spending on electric cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers and commercial vehicles, as well as associated infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nElectrified transport overtook the renewable energy sector, which saw an 8% increase to $623 billion. This figure reflects investment to construct renewable energy production facilities, such as wind, solar and geothermal power plants, and biofuels production plants – among other things. Power grid investment was the third-largest contributor at $310 billion. Grids are a critical enabler for the energy transition, and investment in them will need to rise in the coming years.\\\\n\\\\n“Last year brought new records for global renewable energy investment. Strong growth in the US and Europe drove the global rise, even as China, the world’s largest renewables market, sputtered, recording an 11% drop. Despite a year of tough headlines, a record amount of offshore wind capacity also reached financial close,” said Meredith Annex, BNEF’s Head of Clean Power and co-author of the report.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also strong growth in emerging areas such as hydrogen (with investment tripling year on year), carbon capture and storage (near-doubling) and energy storage (up 76%).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/ETIT_FIG1news.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe largest country for investment by far was China, with $676 billion invested in 2023 – equivalent to 38% of the global total. Although China remains dominant, its lead has been reduced. Taken together, the European Union, US and UK outpaced China with $737 billion of investment – a feat they hadn’t managed to achieve in 2022. Investment in the US jumped 22% year-on-year, to $303 billion, as the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act started to be felt.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/newetit_image.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe current level of investment in clean energy technologies is not nearly sufficient to set the world on track for net zero by mid-century. According to the report, energy transition investment would need to average $4.8 trillion per year from 2024 to 2030 to align with BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario, a Paris Agreement-aligned trajectory from the 2022 New Energy Outlook. This is nearly three times the total investment observed in 2023.\\\\n\\\\n“Our report shows just how quickly the clean energy opportunity is growing, and yet how far off track we still are,” said Albert Cheung, Deputy CEO of BNEF. “Energy transition investment spending grew 17% last year, but it needs to grow more than 170% if we are to get on track for net zero in the coming years. Only determined action from policymakers can unlock this kind of step-change in momentum.”\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, BNEF’s report finds that investment in the global clean energy supply chain, including equipment factories and battery metals production for energy technologies, hit a new record at $135 billion in 2023 (up from just $46 billion in 2020), and is set to surge further over the next two years. BNEF projects this figure to rise to $259 billion by 2025, based on currently announced investment plans. In the next two years, only the wind sector needs to increase its supply chain investment to get on track for a net-zero trajectory; the other areas are investing at a sufficient pace.\\\\n\\\\nAntoine Vagneur-Jones, Head of Trade and Supply Chains at BNEF, said, “Abundant supply chain investment should continue to tamp down equipment prices across most sectors, which is good news for the energy transition. But the ensuing oversupply heralds an era of squeezed margins for solar and battery manufacturers.”\\\\n\\\\nAside from tracking the funding for clean energy deployment and clean energy supply chain investment, the _Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024_ report also tracks two other types of funding:\\\\n\\\\nClimate-tech equity raising\\\\n---------------------------\\\\n\\\\n: Equity raised by companies focused on climate and the energy transition (_$84 billion in 2023_)\\\\n\\\\no This figure has fallen for the past two years, as rising interest rates have made it harder for companies to raise capital. Companies had raised $168 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022.\\\\n\\\\n o Clean energy-focused companies raised more equity than any other sector in 2023, at $49 billion.\\\\n\\\\n o Companies in the clean transport sector saw funding drop the most sharply, from $47 billion raised in 2022 to just $18 billion in 2023. Transport remained the second-largest funding sector, followed by Industry, Buildings, Agriculture and ‘Climate and Carbon’.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy transition debt issuance\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n: Debt issued by companies and governments to fund the energy transition (_$824 billion in 2023_)\\\\n\\\\no This figure rose by 4% in 2023 after dropping 10% in 2022. Stabilizing or falling interest rates in various markets helped companies and governments raise debt for energy transition purposes and these trends are reflective of the broader market.\\\\n\\\\n o Utilities raised the most debt for the energy transition ($328 billion), followed by financial institutions ($176 billion) and governments ($141 billion)\\\\n\\\\n o Oil and gas companies’ energy transition debt issuance fell to $8.3 billion, down from $17.5 billion in 2022.\\\\n\\\\nContact\\\\n-------\\\\n\\\\nOktavia Catsaros\\\\n\\\\n BloombergNEF\\\\n\\\\n +1 212 617 9209\\\\n\\\\n[ocatsaros@bloomberg.net](mailto:ocatsaros@bloomberg.net)\\\\n\\\\nAbout Bloomberg\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\nBloomberg is a global leader in business and financial information, delivering trusted data, news, and insights that bring transparency, efficiency, and fairness to markets.

Unlike conventional energy sources such as fossil fuel, which require millions of years for formation, renewable energy sources are sources that constantly renew throughout the human lifespan. The key advantages of using renewable energy source are inexhaustibility and low impact on the environment. With global warming and air & water pollution being major issues related to the use of fossil fuels, renewable energy provides a better option in reducing the climate change. In addition, renewable energy is used to overcome the high cost incurred by industries who use fossil to generate electricity. For this reason, renewable energy is gaining prominence for both economic and strategic viewpoint for large industries. The large demand for energy by developed countries has enforced them towards the use of renewable sources of energy to meet the high energy demand. Environmental safety and security being at the outmost priority for the government as well for the society is expected to have a positive impact on renewable energy market.\\\\n\\\\nThe global renewable energy market was valued at $1.1 trillion in 2023, and is projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2033.\\\\n\\\\nAsia-Pacific is the largest regional market for Renewable Energy.\\\\n\\\\nResidential sector is the leading application of Renewable Energy Market.\\\\n\\\\nIntegration of renewable energy in smart grids are the upcoming trends of Renewable Energy Market in the globe.\\\\n\\\\nThe major players operating in the renewable energy market include Xcel Energy Inc., General Electric, ACCIONA, Tata Power, National Grid Renewables, Invenergy, ABB, Enel Green Power S.p.A., EDF Renewables, and Innergex.\\\\n\\\\nLoading Table Of Content...\\\\n\\\\n![Offer Banner](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/assets/bannerImages/amr-banner-1745228860-B-2025-04-21-1745228860.png \\\\\"Offer Banner\\\\\")\\\\n![Allied Market Research Footer Logo](assets/images/rev_images/amr-logo.png \\\\\"Allied Market Research\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCompany\\\\n\\\\nFind Help\\\\n\\\\nOur Product & Services\\\\n\\\\nResource Center\\\\n\\\\n![ISO Standard Logo](assets/images/rev_images/iso-image.webp \\\\\"ISO Standard Registered Logo\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n© 2025 Allied Market Research.

This marks a fast divergence from five years ago, when fossil fuels and clean energy investments were essentially even.\\\\n\\\\nThe torch is now being carried by solar, which is soon to overtake oil production said IEA. Almost 90% of new power generation\\xa0investments are now tied to solar and other low-carbon technologies, said the report.\\\\n\\\\nAbout $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, $1.7 trillion of which will go to clean technologies, with PV leading the way as the largest contributor of energy generation. The remaining roughly $1 trillion is expected to be invested in fossil fuels. Annual clean energy investment is expected to rise by 24% between 2021 and 2023, driven by renewables and electric vehicles, compared with a 15% rise in fossil fuel investment over the same period.\\\\n\\\\nNearly $700 billion of investment is expected for renewable energy generation. Solar is the star performer with more than $1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023. IEA expects solar investment to total $380 billion for the year as a whole, edging this spending\\xa0above upstream oil for the first time.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with wholesale move toward clean generation is a global shift toward electrification. Global heat pump sales are growing at double-digit annual growth rates since 2021, and electric vehicles are expected to leap one-third this year after already undergoing a landmark year of growth in 2021.\\\\n\\\\nChina is expected to continue as the global frontrunner in clean energy investment, with increased spending of over $170 billion. The nation is followed by the European Union, with about $150 billion in increased investment, and the United States, adding about $100 billion in increased investment. Costs for clean energy edged higher in 2022, but pressures are easing in 2023, and mature clean technologies remain very cost-competitive in today’s fuel-price environment, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nChina alone added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity in 2022, almost 70% higher than in 2021, and annual installations increased by 40% or more in Europe, India and Brazil, despite inflation and supply chain issues.\\\\n\\\\n“While solar deployment has been increasing year-on-year, the project pipeline for some other technologies has been less reliable,” said the report. “Investment in wind power has varied year-on-year in key markets in response to changing policy circumstances. Nuclear investment is rising but hydropower, a key low-emission source of power market flexibility, has been on a downward trend.”\\\\n\\\\nThis investment is gaining momentum due to a powerful alignment of costs, climate, and energy security goals and industrial strategies. The recovery from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to the global energy crisis have provided a significant boost to clean energy investment, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nWhile clean technology investments are rising worldwide, work needs to be done, especially in developing economies, said IEA. Many nations are being held back by higher interest rates, unclear policy frameworks and market designs, weak grid infrastructure, financially strained utilities, and a high cost of capital. However, IEA notes that dynamic investments in solar in India, Brazil, and the Middle East are driving forward these markets.\\\\n\\\\nTo help address some of the above-listed headwinds, the IEA release a new report entitled *Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies* on June 22.\\\\n\\\\nFossil fuel producers made record profits in 2022, though much of this cash flow has gone to dividends, share buybacks, and debt repayment, rather than reinvestment back into traditional supply. IEA said that while a shift to renewables is underway, fossil fuels are expected to continue to drive growth – with oil and gas spending expected to rise 7% this year. Coal demand still remains high in some markets, and the shift from these assets may not be occurring fast enough, as coal investment is pacing to be six times above what IEA envisions for its 2030 Net Zero Scenario.\\\\n\\\\nIEA notes that clean energy among major oil and gas producers is continuing to rise, with solar and wind holding a similar share. Clean energy investment by these fossil fuels companies doubled in 2022 to about $20 billion. This investment represents about 4% of upstream capital and 0.5% of net income. European oil majors are outpacing U.S. oil majors considerably in this category, said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, demand to adopt solar is strong. In its 2023 [Solar Snapshot](https://resources.aurorasolar.com/solar-industry-snapshot/) report, Aurora Solar reported that 45% of solar professionals reported increased demand as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, with another 40% expecting to see increased demand soon, and 70% noted their business grew in size. Nearly 77% of homeowners either have solar or are interested in purchasing it, said Aurora Solar.\\\\n\\\\nIn its 2021 World Energy Outlook report, IEA noted that the world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs. This year, it said, “this picture is starting to change: global energy investment is picking up, and the rise in clean energy investment since 2021 is leading the way, outpacing the increase in fossil fuel investment by almost three to-one.”\\\\n\\\\n“If [clean energy investment] continues to grow at the rate seen since 2021, then aggregate spending in 2030 on low-emission power, grids and storage, and end-use electrification would exceed the levels required to meet the world’s announced climate pledges. For some technologies, notably solar, [investment] would match the investment required to get on track for a 1.5°C stabilization in global average temperatures,” said IEA.\\\\n\\\\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

The Factbook examines how clean energy sectors performed in 2023 and over the past decade.\\\\n\\\\n### Learn more and download the 2024 Factbook here:\\\\n\\\\n[Download the 2024 Factbook](https://bcse.org/factbook)\\\\n\\\\n**Clean Energy Transition Thrives,** Boosted by Federal Policies\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n=\\\\n\\\\n**America’s position in the global clean energy economy is strong.** In 2023, the U.S. energy transition demonstrated its resiliency, with investment and deployment bolstered by a suite of federal policies.\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n**With the clean energy transition already hard-wired into the U.S. economy, investments surged in the first full year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022. In 2023, the U.S. saw market growth both in more mature clean energy technologies and in previously slow-growing, emerging decarbonization solutions.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 2: 1a-Clean-tech Manufacturing](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1a-Clean-tech-Manufacturing.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Top market responses to the IRA tracked by the Factbook include:\\\\n\\\\n*   **PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT:** A record-shattering $303.3 billion in energy transition financing was deployed in the U.S. in 2023 for clean energy technologies, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, power grid investment and others.\\\\n*   **MANUFACTURING:** By the end of 2023, the number of manufacturing facilities planned across North America in response to the IRA rose to 104, representing $123 billion in announced investments. Battery and solar facilities dominate, with 34 facilities planned in each sector.\\\\n*   **RENEWABLE ENERGY:** 42 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power-generating capacity was added to the U.S. grid, driven mainly by robust solar additions.\\\\n*   **ENERGY STORAGE:** 7.5 GW of battery storage capacity was commissioned in the U.S. in 2023, a new record for the country. The U.S. is the second largest market globally for energy storage demand.\\\\n*   **ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS):** EV sales in the U.S. surged 50 percent to nearly 1.46 million vehicles sold. The surge was driven by new EV incentives, price cuts and more EV models released.\\\\n*   **CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS):** New investments in CCS totaled $2.8 billion, up 68 percent from 2022. Around 137 million metric tons annually (Mtpa) of new CCS projects are being planned in the U.S., against an installed base of 23 Mtpa in 2023.\\\\n*   **HYDROGEN:** Investments in hydrogen-producing projects totaled $1.9 billion in 2023, up 82 percent from 2022. A record 437 megawatts of new electrolyzers were shipped to the U.S., a 680 percent year-on-year increase.\\\\n*   **RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG):** U.S. RNG production capacity grew 13 percent in 2023. States that have passed or proposed “green gas” tariffs to enable utilities to use RNG include AR, CA, CO, IA, ID, IL, KS, MA, MI, NC, NE, NH, NJ, NY, OK, OR, PA, UT, VA, VT and WA.\\\\n*   **SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF):** Supply of renewable diesel and jet fuel, also known as SAF, rose 53 percent and 81 percent respectively in 2023. Globally, airlines signed a total of 36 agreements to procure SAF from January to early December. U.S.-based airlines led in procurement, likely due to government incentives such as investment tax credits under the IRA for SAF producers.\\\\n\\\\n**Global investment in the energy transition once again shattered records in 2023, soaring to $1.7 trillion, with the U.S. attracting $303 billion of investment, second to China’s $676 billion.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 3: 1b-Clean-Energy-Investment-2](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1b-Clean-Energy-Investment-2.png)\\\\n\\\\n**The U.S. – and North America in general – offers industrial customers some of the least-cost electricity in the world,** averaging 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2022 (latest data available).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 4: 1c-Industrial Power Prices](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1c-Industrial-Power-Prices.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nThe remarkable performance of clean energy markets in 2023, despite serious market headwinds, demonstrates the important role of federal policies to provide stability and a framework to guide industry growth. Despite higher interest rates and supply chain difficulties, as well as challenges presented by interconnection queues and lengthy permitting processes, the clean energy transition found a way to thrive in 2023 and continue its upward trajectory.\\\\n\\\\nBCSE believes that IRA-led investments are securing America’s economic competitiveness and leadership position in the global market. The record levels of energy transition financing in the U.S. and globally in 2023 are a clear indicator that clean energy is big business.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n=\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, BCSE’s diversified energy portfolio** of energy efficiency, natural gas and renewable energy proved foundational to the U.S. energy economy and its advancements.\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n**The BCSE portfolio of clean energy solutions provides the majority of U.S. electricity.** In 2023, natural gas and renewable energy met 66 percent of U.S. electricity demand, up from 41 percent in 2013.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5: 2a-EnergyGeneration](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2a-EnergyGeneration.png)\\\\n\\\\n### A CLOSER LOOK AT THE ELECTRICITY MIX IN 2023\\\\n\\\\n*   Total U.S. power generation decreased by an estimated 0.9 percent in 2023.\\\\n*   Natural gas remained the largest source of U.S. electricity – providing 43 percent of the total – with 1,809 terawatt-hours (TWh) of production in 2023, up 6.5 percent from 2022.\\\\n*   The contribution of all renewables – including biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, waste-to-energy and wind – rose 1 percent, producing 972 TWh in 2023. A drop in hydropower and wind output was offset by strong solar generation.\\\\n*   Among renewable technologies, the 153 GW wind power fleet produced 428 TWh of electricity in 2023, followed by hydropower with 239 TWh and solar generating projects (utility-scale and rooftop solar) with 237 TWh.\\\\n*   Zero-carbon power (renewable energy generation plus nuclear power) accounted for an all-time high of 41.1 percent of U.S. electricity output in 2023.\\\\n*   Coal-fired generation fell to an all-time low of 15.8 percent of total U.S. power generation.\\\\n\\\\n### A CLOSER LOOK AT ELECTRICTY CAPACITY BUILD IN 2023\\\\n\\\\n*   An estimated 40.5 GW of new utility-scale power generation and storage capacity was commissioned in 2023 – the most in 20 years. Renewable energy was the dominant source, adding 24.1 GW of capacity in 2023. New natural gas-fired power generation capacity rose to 9 GW. Energy storage set a record for the fourth year in a row with 6.2 GW added.\\\\n*   2023 also marked the first year new nuclear power capacity was brought online since 2016.\\\\n*   Total U.S. renewable energy capacity, excluding pumped hydropower facilities, reached 425 GW in 2023. Despite lingering concerns about supply chains, high interest rates, and trade policy worries, the installed fleet of wind and solar capacity grew 13.5 percent for the year.\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nAs the share of U.S. electricity provided by natural gas and renewable energy continued to climb in 2023, the U.S. economy grew while greenhouse gas emissions decreased. This portfolio of low- and zero-carbon resources also offers the flexibility needed to manage the electricity grid.\\\\n\\\\nAs the U.S. energy economy has transformed over time to embrace cleaner resources and become more energy efficient, the energy costs of U.S. consumers have remained relatively low and stable. In 2023, energy spending accounted for 4.2 percent of total U.S. personal consumption expenditures, down 0.6 percentage points from 2022, as the cost of gasoline fell, along with slight drops in the price of natural gas and electricity.\\\\n\\\\nThe benefits of the energy transition, however, are not necessarily equally distributed across the diversity of U.S. communities and regions. Importantly, the Inflation Reduction Act includes provisions that focus investment and aim to lower costs in underserved and low-income communities.\\\\n\\\\n**U.S. energy productivity increased by 3.8 percent in 2023,** as the economy expanded 2.4 percent and U.S. primary energy consumption slowed by 1.4 percent. U.S. energy productivity has grown 30.6 percent over the past decade and has improved 101 percent since 1990.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6: 2b-EnergyProductivity](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2b-EnergyProductivity.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nEnergy productivity – a measure of economic output per unit of energy consumed in the U.S. – is an essential metric to grade our country’s competitiveness in the global market. The three-decade-long upward trajectory of U.S. energy productivity showcases the positive return on public and private sector investments in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is an essential tool in the toolbox needed to meet U.S. decarbonization goals.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n=\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions returned to a much-needed downward trajectory, falling 1.8%,**and led by reductions in the power sector. The U.S. also experienced the highest number of extreme weather events on record.\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: 3a - Greenhouse Emissions Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3a-GreenhouseEmissions-1.png)\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, the U.S. experienced 28 climate-related disasters, the highest number recorded, causing $92.9 billion in damages.** Nineteen of these were severe storms that accounted for 58 percent of total financial damages. Since 2012, roughly 2.8 GW of microgrids, 5,000 megawatt-hours of energy storage, have been brought online. Microgrids are powered by solar, energy storage and diesel generation sets.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 8: Weather Disasters in 2023](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3b-WeatherDisasters-1.png)\\\\n\\\\n### WHY IT MATTERS\\\\n\\\\nU.S. emissions in 2023 were at their lowest levels since 1987, with 2020 the exception due to COVID-19 lockdowns. Emissions fell across all sectors except for transport. Progress remains concentrated in the power sector, which accounted for 83 percent of the overall drop in 2023. The bulk of emission reductions in the power sector to-date can be attributed to coal being displaced by natural gas.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough it is a good sign that U.S. emissions have returned to their downward trajectory, the pace of reductions is not where it needs to be if the U.S. is to meet its current goal under the Paris Agreement to reduce economy-wide emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. In 2023, U.S. emissions were down 16 percent over 2005 levels.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) in the United Arab Emirates, countries agreed to double the average rate of energy efficiency improvements worldwide by 2030, triple the capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030, and begin the transition away from fossil fuel energy systems, with the aim of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The call for accelerated pacing of the global energy transition has near-universal support, and the United States has the technology solutions that are needed.\\\\n\\\\nClimate-related disasters place undue strains on public coffers and community well-being. The U.S. energy system is critical infrastructure that needs immediate attention to avoid the negative consequences of extreme weather and natural disasters.\\\\n\\\\nWhat We Are Watching\\\\n====================\\\\n\\\\n### **U.S. energy infrastructure needs reform of regulatory timelines and processes.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9: Average Project Wait Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4a-AverageProjectWait.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Take Away\\\\n\\\\nAs of January 2024, more than 1,100 GW of projects were undergoing interconnection studies in the seven U.S. independent system operators.\\\\n\\\\n### Dive In\\\\n\\\\nLearn more on Factbook page 50.\\\\n\\\\n### **The U.S. has emerged as a global leader in power sector digitalization.**\\\\n\\\\n![Image 10: Digital Partnerships Graph](https://bcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4b-DigitalPartnerships.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Take Away\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. accounted for 40 percent, or 81 out of 206, of the total digital projects and partnerships in the global power sector in 2023.

This number is a new record level of annual investment and demonstrates the resilience of the clean energy transition in a year of geopolitical turbulence, high interest rates and cost inflation.\\\\n\\\\nThe report finds that electrified transport is now the largest sector for spending in the energy transition, growing 36% in 2023 to $634 billion. This figure includes spending on electric cars, buses, two- and three-wheelers and commercial vehicles, as well as associated infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nElectrified transport overtook the renewable energy sector, which saw an 8% increase to $623 billion. This figure reflects investment to construct renewable energy production facilities, such as wind, solar and geothermal power plants, and biofuels production plants – among other things. Power grid investment was the third-largest contributor at $310 billion. Grids are a critical enabler for the energy transition, and investment in them will need to rise in the coming years.\\\\n\\\\n“Last year brought new records for global renewable energy investment. Strong growth in the US and Europe drove the global rise, even as China, the world’s largest renewables market, sputtered, recording an 11% drop. Despite a year of tough headlines, a record amount of offshore wind capacity also reached financial close,” said Meredith Annex, BNEF’s Head of Clean Power and co-author of the report.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also strong growth in emerging areas such as hydrogen (with investment tripling year on year), carbon capture and storage (near-doubling) and energy storage (up 76%).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/ETIT_FIG1news.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe largest country for investment by far was China, with $676 billion invested in 2023 – equivalent to 38% of the global total. Although China remains dominant, its lead has been reduced. Taken together, the European Union, US and UK outpaced China with $737 billion of investment – a feat they hadn’t managed to achieve in 2022. Investment in the US jumped 22% year-on-year, to $303 billion, as the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act started to be felt.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/newetit_image.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe current level of investment in clean energy technologies is not nearly sufficient to set the world on track for net zero by mid-century. According to the report, energy transition investment would need to average $4.8 trillion per year from 2024 to 2030 to align with BNEF’s Net Zero Scenario, a Paris Agreement-aligned trajectory from the 2022 New Energy Outlook. This is nearly three times the total investment observed in 2023.\\\\n\\\\n“Our report shows just how quickly the clean energy opportunity is growing, and yet how far off track we still are,” said Albert Cheung, Deputy CEO of BNEF. “Energy transition investment spending grew 17% last year, but it needs to grow more than 170% if we are to get on track for net zero in the coming years. Only determined action from policymakers can unlock this kind of step-change in momentum.”\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, BNEF’s report finds that investment in the global clean energy supply chain, including equipment factories and battery metals production for energy technologies, hit a new record at $135 billion in 2023 (up from just $46 billion in 2020), and is set to surge further over the next two years. BNEF projects this figure to rise to $259 billion by 2025, based on currently announced investment plans. In the next two years, only the wind sector needs to increase its supply chain investment to get on track for a net-zero trajectory; the other areas are investing at a sufficient pace.\\\\n\\\\nAntoine Vagneur-Jones, Head of Trade and Supply Chains at BNEF, said, “Abundant supply chain investment should continue to tamp down equipment prices across most sectors, which is good news for the energy transition. But the ensuing oversupply heralds an era of squeezed margins for solar and battery manufacturers.”\\\\n\\\\nAside from tracking the funding for clean energy deployment and clean energy supply chain investment, the _Energy Transition Investment Trends 2024_ report also tracks two other types of funding:\\\\n\\\\nClimate-tech equity raising\\\\n---------------------------\\\\n\\\\n: Equity raised by companies focused on climate and the energy transition (_$84 billion in 2023_)\\\\n\\\\no This figure has fallen for the past two years, as rising interest rates have made it harder for companies to raise capital. Companies had raised $168 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022.\\\\n\\\\n o Clean energy-focused companies raised more equity than any other sector in 2023, at $49 billion.\\\\n\\\\n o Companies in the clean transport sector saw funding drop the most sharply, from $47 billion raised in 2022 to just $18 billion in 2023. Transport remained the second-largest funding sector, followed by Industry, Buildings, Agriculture and ‘Climate and Carbon’.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy transition debt issuance\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n: Debt issued by companies and governments to fund the energy transition (_$824 billion in 2023_)\\\\n\\\\no This figure rose by 4% in 2023 after dropping 10% in 2022.

Infrastructure connects people to opportunities, promotes economic growth, and improves livelihoods.\\xa0 When infrastructure is sustainable, it also lays the path for a more livable planet. However, shifting toward greener infrastructure requires multiple trillions of dollars. With the reality of cash-strapped government budgets, private sector participation is an important solution to filling the financing gap. At the World Bank, we’re pulling out all the stops to enable this transition and make it easier for the private sector to participate in development projects through our work on public-private partnerships, our overhauled guarantees program, and our grants to the world\\'s poorest countries. A key tool in these efforts is our Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) report, the latest of which was released this week. First published in 1984, the PPI report now tracks investments in 10,000 infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries. Pulling from the only database of its kind, the report is a vital resource for tracking progress and identifying trends, especially as infrastructure financing becomes a bigger priority for countries around the globe. It also offers a direct view into the regions and countries, as well as the sectors, receiving infrastructure investments, how these projects are structured, and what role multilateral development banks can best play in these contexts. Our 2023\\xa0Private Participation in Infrastructure report finds that private infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries totaled $86 billion last year. While this is a 5 percent decline in total investments compared with 2022, when trends were looking more hopeful as we emerged from the pandemic, the numbers are on par with the previous five-year average. Here are other key takeaways from our 2023\\xa0PPI report: We saw an increase in the number of countries and projects receiving investments:\\xa0Despite the decline in total investment, many more countries received private investments in infrastructure across a wider range of projects.\\xa0In 2023, 68 countries received investments across 322 projects, compared to 54 countries and 260 projects in 2022. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a continuous increase in the number of countries reporting PPI transactions. Notably, Guinea Bissau, Libya, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Suriname achieved their first PPI transactions in more than a decade. While regional disparities remain, the MENA region saw a doubling of investments:\\xa0Private infrastructure investments declined in most regions in 2023, except in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and East Asia and Pacific (EAP) regions. MENA continued its growth trajectory, with PPI investment levels doubling from $1.4 billion in 2022 to $2.9 billion in 2023. The EAP region returned to pre-pandemic levels of investment after a three-year lag as the region recovered from the effects of COVID-19. The renewable energy sector leads the way, with a tripling of investments:\\xa0In terms of sectoral trends, energy saw a threefold increase in investment levels in 2023, with most of this taking place in the EAP region. In line with the continued global push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, 97 percent of electricity generation projects were renewable in 2023, compared to 93 percent in the previous five-year period.\\xa0 At the country level, almost all countries reported 100 percent of their investments in renewable energy, with solar\\xa0photovoltaic\\xa0technology making up 41 percent of all power generation capacity in low- and middle-income countries. This was followed by wind technology as a cost-effective and reliable source of renewable energy at 29 percent, and hydropower at 17 percent. A record number of projects in the poorest countries have been delivered:\\xa0Twenty-six countries that are a member of the World Bank’s International Development Association received investment commitments amounting to $4.3 billion across 53 projects in 2023. This is an 18 percent increase since 2022 and a record number of projects.\\xa0\\xa0This latest PPI report points to a mixed picture and makes it clear that more needs to be done to mobilize private participation in sustainable infrastructure and thus meet the very real needs of the world’s poorest. This is why boosting private investment in infrastructure is an important part of the\\xa0World Bank Evolution Roadmap, which calls for us to use our financing power strategically, especially in ways that leverage private sector partnerships. It takes creative approaches to build momentum, create bankable projects, and reduce investors’ exposure to risk. We don’t have time to waste on these efforts. ...\", \"status\": \"success\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_DrKGfgBR68viGXkHRhJ4fN88'}, {'content': '{\"url\": \"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/renewable-energy-market\", \"title\": \"Renewable Energy Market Trend and Growth Projection, 2033\", \"content\": \"Renewable Energy Market Trend and Growth Projection, 2033 About Us Report Store AMR in News Blogs Press Releases Request for Consulting Our Clients A* Avenue sale p 2024 Renewable Energy Market Renewable Energy Market Size, Share, Competitive Landscape and Trend Analysis Report, by Type, by End Use : Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2024-2033 EP : Renewable Energy Aug 2024 ✷\\xa0 Report Code: A00060 Pages: 340 Tables: 114 Charts: 58 Select an option Cloud Access (30% Off) $2,601 $1,821 Business User License (30% Off) $4,335 $3,035 Enterprise License (30% Off) $7,261 $5,083 Library Membership (15% Off) $1,175 $999 Buy Now Request Free Sample Author\\'s: Mayur Mahajan | Eswara Prasad Publish Date: Enquire Before Buying Customization Request Speak with Analyst Get Sample to Email Submit Thank You For Your Response ! Our Executive will get back to you soon Renewable Energy Market Research, 2033The global renewable energy market size was valued at $1.1 trillion in 2023, and is projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2024 to 2033.Market Introduction and DefinitionRenewable energy refers to energy that is generated from naturally replenishing sources referred to as infinite resources. These sources include sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy sources are sustainable and have minimal impact on the environment as compared to fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which are finite and contribute to environmental degradation through greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.The adoption of renewable energy has gained momentum globally due to increase in concerns about climate change, energy security, and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves. Governments, businesses, and individuals are investing in renewable energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify energy sources, and promote sustainable development. In addition, advancements in technology and declining costs have made renewable energy increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources, driving its rapid deployment and integration into the energy mix. Renewable energy plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change and ensuring a reliable and resilient energy supply as the world transitions towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.Key TakeawaysThe renewable energy market report covers 20 countries. The research includes a segment analysis of each country in terms of value for the projected period.More than 1,500 product literatures, industry releases, annual reports, and other such documents of major renewable energy industry participants along with authentic industry journals, trade associations\\' releases, and government websites have been reviewed for generating high-value industry insights.The study integrated high-quality data, professional opinions and analysis, and critical independent perspectives. The research approach is intended to provide a balanced view of global markets and to assist stakeholders in making educated decisions to achieve their most ambitious growth objectives.Key Market DynamicsThe growing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria among investors has led to a significant shift towards sustainable investments. Companies and financial institutions are increasingly prioritizing renewable energy projects to align with their ESG goals, attracting a broader base of socially conscious investors. This trend boosts the demand for clean energy market and fosters innovation and competitiveness within the sector. As more capital is directed towards clean energy industry, economies of scale are achieved, leading to cost reductions and technological advancements, which further stimulate market demand and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. In addition, government policies and incentives play a crucial role in driving the demand for renewable energy. All these factors are expected to drive the growth of the renewable energy market during the forecast period.However, high capital costs hinder the adoption of renewable energy by residential and small business consumers. Although the long-term savings from reduced energy bills and potential earnings from selling excess power back to the grid are substantial, the initial cost of purchasing and installing renewable energy systems are prohibitive. In addition, the cost of installing renewable energy infrastructure often includes the expenses for advanced technology, specialized equipment, and extensive site preparation. For instance, the initial costs for solar panel installations involve the panels themselves and the inverters, mounting systems, and labor. All these factors hamper the\\xa0renewable energy market growth.The integration of renewable energy into smart grids enhances energy efficiency and reduces system losses. Smart meters, sensors, and automation technologies allow for more precise monitoring and control of electricity consumpti...\", \"status\": \"success\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_ZUWgMUbTedUM37tC938xgZra'}, {'content': '{\"url\": \"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/31/global-investment-in-clean-energy-nearly-doubles-that-of-fossil-fuels/\", \"content\": \"\", \"status\": \"error\", \"error\": \"403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/05/31/global-investment-in-clean-energy-nearly-doubles-that-of-fossil-fuels/\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Fzb9lOZyPxQ4KEst05QbOits'}, {'content': '{\"url\": \"https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2023/overview-and-key-findings\", \"title\": \"Overview and key findings – World Energy Investment 2023 – Analysis - IEA\", \"content\": \"Overview and key findings – World Energy Investment 2023 – Analysis - IEA IEA Close Search Search You are connecting via IP recognition from .

Comparing our estimates for 2023 with the data for 2021, annual clean energy investment has risen much faster than investment in fossil fuels over this period (24% vs 15%). Our new analysis highlights how the period of intense volatility in fossil fuel markets caused by the Russian Federation’s (hereafter “Russia”) invasion of Ukraine has accelerated momentum behind the deployment of a range of clean energy technologies, even as it also prompted a short-term scramble for oil and gas supply.We estimate that around USD\\xa02.8\\xa0trillion will be invested in energy in 2023. More than USD\\xa01.7\\xa0trillion is going to clean energy, including renewable power, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emission fuels, efficiency improvements and end-use renewables and electrification. The remainder, slightly over USD\\xa01\\xa0trillion, is going to unabated fossil fuel supply and power, of which around 15% is to coal and the rest to oil and gas. For every USD\\xa01 spent on fossil fuels, USD\\xa01.7 is now spent on clean energy. Five years ago this ratio was 1:1. Clean energy investments have been boosted by a variety of factors. These include improved economics at a time of high and volatile fossil fuel prices; enhanced policy support through instruments like the US Inflation Reduction Act and new initiatives in Europe, Japan, the People’s Republic of China (hereafter “China”) and elsewhere; a strong alignment of climate and energy security goals, especially in import-dependent economies; and a focus on industrial strategy as countries seek to strengthen their footholds in the emerging clean energy economy.This momentum has been led by renewable power and EVs, with important contributions also from other areas such as batteries, heat pumps and nuclear power. In 2023 low-emissions power is expected to account for almost 90% of total investment in electricity generation. Solar is the star performer and more than USD\\xa01\\xa0billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023 (USD 380\\xa0billion for the year as a whole), edging this spending above that in upstream oil for the first time. Consumers are investing in more electrified end uses. Demand for electric cars is booming, with sales expected to leap by more than one-third this year after a record-breaking 2022. As a result, investment in EVs (defined as the incremental spending on EVs vs the average price of vehicles sold in a given country) has more than doubled since 2021, reaching USD\\xa0130\\xa0billion in 2023. Global sales of heat pumps have seen double-digit growth since 2021. The increase in fossil fuel investment expected in 2023 is unevenly spread around the world; less than half the cash flow available to the oil and gas industry is going back into new supply...\", \"status\": \"success\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_3lI13BOtNIS0RsT39z0Ik17a'}, {'content': '{\"url\": \"https://bcse.org/market-trends-2024/2024-key-trends/\", \"title\": \"2024 Key Trends - Business Council for Sustainable Energy\", \"content\": \"2024 Key Trends - Business Council for Sustainable Energy Sustainable Energy in America 2024 Factbook Tracking Market & Policy Trends The Sustainable Energy in America Factbook provides valuable year-over-year data and insights on the American energy transformation.

Learn more and download the 2024 Factbook here: Download the 2024 Factbook Clean Energy Transition Thrives, Boosted by Federal Policies 1 America’s position in the global clean energy economy is strong. In 2023, the U.S. energy transition demonstrated its resiliency, with investment and deployment bolstered by a suite of federal policies. With the clean energy transition already hard-wired into the U.S. economy, investments surged in the first full year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022. In 2023, the U.S. saw market growth both in more mature clean energy technologies and in previously slow-growing, emerging decarbonization solutions. Top market responses to the IRA tracked by the Factbook include: PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT: A record-shattering $303.3 billion in energy transition financing was deployed in the U.S. in 2023 for clean energy technologies, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, power grid investment and others. MANUFACTURING: By the end of 2023, the number of manufacturing facilities planned across North America in response to the IRA rose to 104, representing $123 billion in announced investments. Battery and solar facilities dominate, with 34 facilities planned in each sector. RENEWABLE ENERGY: 42 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power-generating capacity was added to the U.S. grid, driven mainly by robust solar additions. ENERGY STORAGE: 7.5 GW of battery storage capacity was commissioned in the U.S. in 2023, a new record for the country. The U.S. is the second largest market globally for energy storage demand. ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS): EV sales in the U.S. surged 50 percent to nearly 1.46 million vehicles sold. The surge was driven by new EV incentives, price cuts and more EV models released. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS): New investments in CCS totaled $2.8 billion, up 68 percent from 2022. Around 137 million metric tons annually (Mtpa) of new CCS projects are being planned in the U.S., against an installed base of 23 Mtpa in 2023. HYDROGEN: Investments in hydrogen-producing projects totaled $1.9 billion in 2023, up 82 percent from 2022. A record 437 megawatts of new electrolyzers were shipped to the U.S., a 680 percent year-on-year increase. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS (RNG): U.S. RNG production capacity grew 13 percent in 2023. States that have passed or proposed “green gas” tariffs to enable utilities to use RNG include AR, CA, CO, IA, ID, IL, KS, MA, MI, NC, NE, NH, NJ, NY, OK, OR, PA, UT, VA, VT and WA. SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF): Supply of renewable diesel and jet fuel, also known as SAF, rose 53 percent and 81 percent respectively in 2023. Globally, airlines signed a total of 36 agreements to procure SAF from January to early December. U.S.-based airlines led in procurement, likely due to government incentives such as investment tax credits under the IRA for SAF producers. Global investment in the energy transition once again shattered records in 2023, soaring to $1.7 trillion, with the U.S. attracting $303 billion of investment, second to China’s $676 billion. The U.S. – and North America in general – offers industrial customers some of the least-cost electricity in the world, averaging 8.6 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2022 (latest data available). WHY IT MATTERS The remarkable performance of clean energy markets in 2023, despite serious market headwinds, demonstrates the important role of federal policies to provide stability and a framework to guide industry growth. Despite higher interest rates and supply chain difficulties, as well as challenges presented by interconnection queues and lengthy permitting processes, the clean energy transition found a way to thrive in 2023 and continue its upward trajectory. BCSE believes that IRA-led investments are securing America’s economic competitiveness and leadership position in the global market. The record levels of energy transition financing in the U.S. and globally in 2023 are a clear indicator that clean energy is big business. 2 In 2023, BCSE’s diversified energy portfolio of energy efficiency, natural gas and renewable energy proved foundational to the U.S. energy economy and its advancements.

While the increases in renewable capacity in Europe, the United States and Brazil hit all-time highs, China’s acceleration was extraordinary. In 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, while its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Globally, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide.\\\\n\\\\n#### Achieving the COP28 target of tripling global renewable capacity by 2030 hinges on policy implementation\\\\n\\\\n**Prior to the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai, the International Energy Agency (IEA) urged governments to support five pillars for action by 2030, among them the goal of tripling global renewable power capacity.**Several of the IEA priorities were reflected in the Global Stocktake text agreed by the 198 governments at COP28, including the goals of tripling renewables and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030. Tripling global renewable capacity in the power sector from 2022 levels by 2030 would take it above 11 000 GW, in line with IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.\\\\n\\\\n**Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7 300 GW by 2028. This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030, falling short of the tripling goal.**Governments can close the gap to reach over 11 000 GW by 2030 by overcoming current challenges and implementing existing policies more quickly. These challenges fall into four main categories and differ by country: 1)policy uncertainties and delayed policy responses to the new macroeconomic environment; 2)insufficient investment in grid infrastructure preventing faster expansion of renewables; 3)cumbersome administrative barriers and permitting procedures and social acceptance issues; 4)insufficient financing in emerging and developing economies. This report’s accelerated case shows that addressing those challenges can lead to almost 21% higher growth of renewables, pushing the world towards being on track to meet the global tripling pledge.\\\\n\\\\n### Cumulative renewable electricity capacity in the main and accelerated cases and Net Zero Scenario\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/cumulative-renewable-electricity-capacity-in-the-main-and-accelerated-cases-and-net-zero-scenario)\\\\n\\\\n**What is needed to reach the collective target to triple renewables by 2030 varies significantly by country and region. G20 countries account for almost 90% of global renewable power capacity today.**In the accelerated case, which assumes enhanced implementation of existing policies and targets, the G20 could triple their collective installed capacity by 2030. As such, they have the potential to contribute significantly to tripling renewables globally. However, to achieve the global goal, the rate of new installations needs to accelerate in other countries, too, including many emerging and developing economies outside the G20, some of which do not have renewable targets and/or supportive policies today.\\\\n\\\\n#### The global power mix will be transformed by 2028\\\\n\\\\n**The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the next five years than has been installed since the first commercial renewable energy power plant was built more than 100 years ago.**In the main case forecast in this report, almost 3 700 GW of new renewable capacity comes online over the 2023‑2028 period, driven by supportive policies in more than 130 countries. Solar PV and wind will account for 95% of global renewable expansion, benefiting from lower generation costs than both fossil and non‑fossil fuel alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nOver the coming five years, several renewable energy milestones are expected to be achieved:\\\\n\\\\n*   In 2024, wind and solar PV together generate more electricity than hydropower.\\\\n*   In 2025, renewables surpass coal to become the largest source of electricity generation.\\\\n*   Wind and solar PV each surpass nuclear electricity generation in 2025 and 2026 respectively.\\\\n*   In 2028, renewable energy sources account for over 42% of global electricity generation, with the share of wind and solar PV doubling to 25%.\\\\n\\\\n### Share of renewable electricity generation by technology, 2000-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/share-of-renewable-electricity-generation-by-technology-2000-2028)\\\\n\\\\n#### China is the world’s renewables powerhouse\\\\n\\\\n**China accounts for almost 60% of new renewable capacity expected to become operational globally by 2028.** Despite the phasing out of national subsidies in 2020 and 2021, deployment of onshore wind and solar PV in China is accelerating, driven by the technologies’ economic attractiveness as well as supportive policy environments providing long-term contracts. Our forecast shows that China is expected to reach its national 2030 target for wind and solar PV installations this year, six years ahead of schedule. China’s role is critical in reaching the global goal of tripling renewables because the country is expected to install more than half of the new capacity required globally by 2030. At the end of the forecast period, almost half of China’s electricity generation will come from renewable energy sources.\\\\n\\\\n### Renewable electricity capacity growth in China, main case, 2005-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/renewable-electricity-capacity-growth-in-china-main-case-2005-2028)\\\\n\\\\n### Renewable electricity capacity growth by country or region, main case, 2005-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/renewable-electricity-capacity-growth-by-country-or-region-main-case-2005-2028)\\\\n\\\\n#### The US, the EU, India and Brazil remain bright spots for onshore wind and solar PV growth\\\\n\\\\n**Solar PV and onshore wind additions through 2028 is expected to more than double in the United States, the European Union, India and Brazil compared with the last five years.** Supportive policy environments and the improving economic attractiveness of solar PV and onshore wind are the primary drivers behind this acceleration. In the European Union and Brazil, growth in rooftop solar PV is expected to outpace large-scale plants as residential and commercial consumers seek to reduce their electricity bills amid higher prices. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has acted as a catalyst for accelerated additions despite supply chain issues and trade concerns in the near term. In India, an expedited auction schedule for utility-scale onshore wind and solar PV along with improved financial health of distribution companies is expected to deliver accelerated growth.\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy expansion also starts accelerating in other regions of the world, notably the Middle East and North Africa, owing mostly to policy incentives that take advantage of the cost-competitiveness of solar PV and onshore wind power. Although renewable capacity growth picks up in sub‑Saharan Africa, the region still underperforms considering its resource potential and electrification needs.\\\\n\\\\n#### Solar PV prices plummet amid growing supply glut\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, spot prices for solar PV modules declined by almost 50% year-on-year, with manufacturing capacity reaching three times 2021 levels.** The current manufacturing capacity under construction indicates that the global supply of solar PV will reach 1 100 GW at the end of 2024, with potential output expected to be three times the current forecast for demand. Despite unprecedented PV manufacturing expansion in the United States and India driven by policy support, China is expected to maintain its 80‑95% share of global supply chains (depending on the manufacturing segment). Although developing domestic PV manufacturing will increase the security of supply and bring economic benefits to local communities, replacing imports with more expensive production in the United States, India and the European Union will increase the cost of overall PV deployment in these markets.\\\\n\\\\n#### Onshore wind and solar PV are cheaper than both new and existing fossil fuel plants\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, an estimated 96% of newly installed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind capacity had lower generation costs than new coal and natural gas plants.** In addition, three-quarters of new wind and solar PV plants offered cheaper power than existing fossil fuel facilities. Wind and solar PV systems will become more cost-competitive during the forecast period. Despite the increasing contribution needs for flexibility and reliability to integrate variable renewables, the overall competitiveness of onshore wind and solar PV changes only slightly by 2028 in Europe, China, India and the United States.\\\\n\\\\n#### The new macroeconomic environment presents further challenges that policy makers need to address\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, new renewable energy capacity financed in advanced economies was exposed to higher base interest rates than in China and the global average for the first time.**Since 2022, central bank base interest rates have increased from below 1% to almost 5%. In emerging and developing economies, renewables developers have been exposed to higher interest rates since 2021, resulting in higher costs hampering faster expansion of renewables.\\\\n\\\\n**The implications of this new macroeconomic environment are manifold for both governments and industry.** First, inflation has increased equipment costs for onshore and offshore wind and partly for solar PV (excluding module costs). Second, higher interest rates are increasing the financing costs of capital-intensive variable renewable technologies. Third, policy has been relatively slow to adjust to the new macroeconomic environment due in part to expectations that cost reductions would continue together with permitting challenges. This has left several auctions in advanced economies undersubscribed, particularly in Europe. Additionally, some developers whose power purchase contracts were signed prior to these macroeconomic changes have had to cancel their projects. Efforts to improve auction design and contract indexation methodologies are needed to resolve these challenges and unlock additional wind and solar PV deployment.\\\\n\\\\n**The renewable energy industry, particularly wind, is grappling with macroeconomic challenges affecting its financial health – despite a history of financial resilience.**The wind industry has experienced a significant decline in market value as European and North American wind turbine manufacturers have seen negative net margins for seven consecutive quarters due to volatile demand, limited raw material access, economic challenges, and rising interest rates. To address these issues, the European Union launched a Wind Power Action Plan in October 2023, aiming to enhance competitiveness, improve auction design, boost clean technology investment, streamline permitting, and ensure fair competition. Chinese wind turbine manufacturers, benefiting from strong domestic demand and vertical integration, remain relatively stable amid global challenges.\\\\n\\\\n### Weighted average net margins of renewable energy companies, large utilities and oil majors, Q1-Q4 2022 and Q1-Q3 2023\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/weighted-average-net-margins-of-renewable-energy-companies-large-utilities-and-oil-majors-q1-q4-2022-and-q1-q3-2023)\\\\n\\\\n#### The forecast for wind capacity additions is less optimistic outside China, especially for offshore\\\\n\\\\n**The wind industry, especially in Europe and North America is facing challenges due to a combination of ongoing supply chain disruptions, higher costs and long permitting timelines.** As a result of these challenges, the forecast for onshore wind outside of China has been revised downwards as overall project development has been slower than expected.\\\\n\\\\n**Offshore wind has been hit hardest by the new macroeconomic environment, with its expansion through 2028 revised down by 15% outside China.**The challenges facing the industry particularly affect offshore wind, with investment costs today more than 20% higher than only a few years ago. In 2023, developers have cancelled or postponed 15 GW of offshore wind projects in the United States and the United Kingdom. For some developers, pricing for previously awarded capacity does not reflect the increased costs facing project development today, which reduces project bankability.\\\\n\\\\n#### Faster deployment of variable renewables increases integration and infrastructure challenges\\\\n\\\\n**The share of solar PV and wind in global electricity generation is forecast to double to 25% in 2028 in our main case.**This rapid expansion in the next five years will have implications for power systems worldwide. In the European Union, annual variable renewables penetration in 2028 is expected to reach more than 50% in seven countries, with Denmark having around 90% of wind and solar PV in its electricity system by that time. Although European Union interconnections help integrate solar PV and wind generation, grid bottlenecks will pose significant challenges and lead to increased curtailment in many countries as grid expansion cannot keep pace with accelerated installation of variable renewables.\\\\n\\\\n#### Current hydrogen plans and implementation don’t match\\\\n\\\\n**Renewable power capacity dedicated to hydrogen-based fuel production is forecast to grow by 45 GW between 2023 and 2028, representing only an estimated 7% of announced project capacity for the period.** China, Saudi Arabia and the United States account for more than 75% of renewable capacity for hydrogen production by 2028. Despite announcements of new projects and pipelines, the progress in planned projects has been slow. We have revised down our forecasts for all regions except China. The main reason is the slow pace of bringing planned projects to final investment decisions due to a lack of off‑takers and the impact of higher prices on production costs. The development of an international hydrogen market is a key uncertainty affecting the forecast, particularly for markets that have limited domestic demand for hydrogen.\\\\n\\\\n#### Biofuel deployment is accelerating and diversifying more into renewable diesel and biojet fuel\\\\n\\\\n**Emerging economies, led by Brazil, dominate global biofuel expansion, which is set to grow 30% faster than over the last five years.** Supported by robust biofuel policies, increasing transport fuel demand and abundant feedstock potential, emerging economies are forecast to drive 70% of global biofuel demand growth over the forecast period. Brazil alone accounts for 40% of biofuel expansion to 2028. Stronger policies are the primary driver of this growth as governments expand efforts to provide affordable, secure and low-emission energy supplies. Biofuels used in the road transport sector remain the primary source of new supply, accounting for nearly 90% of the expansion.\\\\n\\\\n### Five-year biofuel demand growth for advanced and emerging economies, main case, 2011-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/five-year-biofuel-demand-growth-for-advanced-and-emerging-economies-main-case-2011-2028)\\\\n\\\\n**Electric vehicles (EVs) and biofuels are proving to be a powerful complementary combination for reducing oil demand**. Globally, biofuels and renewable electricity used in EVs are forecast to offset 4 million barrels of oil‑equivalent per day by 2028, which is more than 7% of forecast oil demand for transport. Biofuels remain the dominant pathway for avoiding oil demand in the diesel and jet fuel segments. EVs outpace biofuels in the gasoline segment, especially in the United States, Europe and China.\\\\n\\\\n#### Aligning biofuels with a net zero pathway requires a huge increase in the pace of deployment\\\\n\\\\n**This report’s main case forecast is not in line with the near tripling of biofuels demand by 2030 seen in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.**In the aviation sector for instance, the Net Zero Scenario would require 8% of fuel supply coming from biojet fuel by 2030, while existing policies in this forecast will only bring biojet fuel’s share to 1% by 2028. Bridging this gap requires new and stronger policies, as well as diversification of feedstocks.\\\\n\\\\n**Much faster biofuel deployment is possible through new policies and addressing supply chain challenges.** In this report’s accelerated case, biofuel supply growth is nearly triple that of the main case, closing the gap with the Net Zero Scenario by nearly 40%. Nearly half of this additional growth, almost 30 billion litres, is driven by strengthened policies in existing markets such as the United States, Europe and India. Another 20 billion litres comes mainly from biodiesel in India and ethanol in Indonesia. Biojet fuel offers a third growth avenue, expanding to cover nearly 3.5% of global aviation fuels, up from 1% in the main case. Fuels made from waste and residues also grow four times faster in the accelerated case.\\\\n\\\\n#### Renewable heat accelerates amid high energy prices and policy momentum – but not enough to curb emissions\\\\n\\\\n**Modern renewable heat consumption expands by 40% globally during the outlook period, rising from 13% to 17% of total heat consumption.**These developments come predominantly from the growing reliance on electricity for process heat – notably with the adoption of heat pumps in non‑energy‑intensive industries – and the deployment of electric heat pumps and boilers in buildings, increasingly powered by renewable electricity. China, the European Union and the United States lead these trends, owing to supportive policy environments; updated targets in the European Union and China; strong financial incentives in many markets; the adoption of renewable heat obligations; and fossil fuel bans in the buildings sector.\\\\n\\\\n**However, the trends to 2028 are still largely insufficient to tackle the use of fossil fuels for heat and put the world on track to meet Paris Agreement goals.** Without stronger policy action, the global heat sector alone between 2023 and 2028 could consume more than one‑fifth of the remaining carbon budget for a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Global renewable heat consumption would have to rise 2.2 times as quickly and be combined with wide-scale demand-side measures and much larger energy and material efficiency improvements to align with the NZE Scenario.\\\\n\\\\nNext[Electricity](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/electricity#abstract)\\\\n\\\\n### Newsletters\\\\n\\\\nThe best of IEA sent straight to your inbox\\\\n\\\\n[Subscribe to newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 25](https://www.iea.org/assets/front/images/footer/footer-newsletters.png?w=260&h=196&fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format)\\\\n\\\\n### Podcasts\\\\n\\\\nTop energy experts put IEA analysis in context\\\\n\\\\n[Listen to our podcast](https://www.iea.org/podcasts)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 26](https://www.iea.org/assets/front/images/footer/footer-podcast.png?w=260&h=213&fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format)\\\\n\\\\n*   Understand energy\\\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\\\n*   [Countries and regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\\\n\\\\n*   Explore data\\\\n*   [Data explorers](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-explorers)\\\\n*   [Data sets](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)\\\\n*   [Policies database](https://www.iea.org/policies)\\\\n*   [Chart library](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts)\\\\n*   [Energy Statistics Browser](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics#browser)\\\\n\\\\n*   IEA essentials\\\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\\\n*   [Mission](https://www.iea.org/about/mission)\\\\n*   [Membership](https://www.iea.org/about/membership)\\\\n*   [Structure](https://www.iea.org/about/structure)\\\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\\\n*   [International collaborations](https://www.iea.org/about/international-collaborations)\\\\n*   [Technology collaboration](https://www.iea.org/about/technology-collaboration)\\\\n*   [Training](https://www.iea.org/about/training)\\\\n\\\\n*   Connect\\\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\\\n*   [Internships](https://www.iea.org/about/internships)\\\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\\\n*   [Help centre](https://www.iea.org/help-centre)\\\\n\\\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\\\n\\\\n©2025 IEA\\\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\\\n\\\\n[](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/executive-summary#header)\\\\n\\\\n#### Subscription successful\\\\n\\\\nThank you for subscribing.

Solar and wind power are key beneficiaries, with tax credits and grants incentivizing rapid adoption. Globally, investments in low-carbon energy hit **$1.1 trillion in 2022**, according to [BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/energy-transition-investment/), while the U.S. clean energy sector is projected to create **millions of jobs** by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nYet challenges persist. In February 2023, **60% of U.S. electricity** still came from fossil fuels, versus **21.5% from renewables**—a disconnect between policy goals and real-world implementation.\\\\n\\\\n**How do Americans view this transition?**  \\\\nWe surveyed **400+ U.S. adults** to explore:\\\\n\\\\nThe results offer actionable insights for businesses and policymakers navigating this critical decade for climate action.\\\\n\\\\n## Outlook Toward Renewable Energy in the US\\\\n\\\\nSolar energy is the most recognized renewable source among Americans (73%), followed by wind (48%) and hydropower (30%). However, **the U.S. is the world’s second-largest renewable energy producer, trailing only China**. Actual usage tells a different story: solar accounts for just 16% of U.S. renewable electricity generation, while wind (48%) and hydropower (29%) dominate. **Wind power alone generated 10% of the nation’s total electricity in 2022**, underscoring its outsized role. Together, renewables supplied **21.5% of total U.S. electricity** in early 2023, per the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3).\\\\n\\\\n![Familiarity with Renewable Energy Sources in the US](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image6-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe majority of Americans also showed a positive perception of renewable energy in the US. The data reflecting a combined percentage of 64.1% for ‘positive’ and ‘very positive’ responses indicates a prevailing shift in attitudes towards renewable energy in the US.\\\\n\\\\nThis shift can be attributed to various factors, including heightened awareness of climate change, increased education about the benefits of renewable energy, and the growing emphasis on sustainable living.\\\\n\\\\nA 2022 [study](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-age-race-ethnicity-gender/) by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication revealed that younger Americans are becoming more concerned about global warming than they were a decade ago.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Americans Want to Switch to Renewable Energy\\\\n\\\\n### **Current Adoption Trends**\\\\n\\\\nToday, **30% of Americans** use renewable energy at home or work—but nearly the same percentage (30%) are unsure whether their energy sources are clean.\\\\n\\\\nAmong adopters, **70% rely on solar power**, primarily through rooftop panels, highlighting its visibility in residential markets. By contrast, solar accounts for just **16% of utility-scale renewable electricity**, reflecting slower institutional adoption.\\\\n\\\\n![Most Utilized Renewable Energy Sources in the US](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image5-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### **Sentiment Toward Transition**\\\\n\\\\nPublic enthusiasm is rising: **32.5% of Americans** are open to adopting renewables, while only **7% oppose the idea entirely**. Advocacy is even stronger: **66.5%** would recommend renewables to others, with **36%** being passionate advocates. Resistance is minimal, with less than **10%** expressing reluctance.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Drivers of Adoption**  \\\\nThree factors dominate decision-making:\\\\n\\\\nThis disconnect—**strong public support but lagging infrastructure**—suggests a cultural shift outpacing systemic change.\\\\n\\\\n![image7 1](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image7-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### Challenges Hindering the Adoption\\\\n\\\\n**1. Cost Barriers**  \\\\n**44% of Americans** cite affordability as the top hurdle. For example, residential solar panel installations cost **$4,500–$36,000** (averaging $16,000), with pricing shaped by home size, location, and equipment efficiency (Forbes).\\\\n\\\\n**2. Awareness Gaps**  \\\\n**1 in 4 respondents** lacks basic knowledge about renewable options, while **11%** fear technical hurdles like installation complexity or grid integration issues (e.g., inconsistent energy storage).\\\\n\\\\n**3. Systemic Inertia**  \\\\nWhile households embrace rooftop solar, utility-scale adoption lags. Bridging this gap requires simpler processes, public-private partnerships, and consumer education campaigns.\\\\n\\\\n![Biggest Challenges Facing Americans in the Adoption of Renewable Energy](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image8-1080x609.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n## To Wrap Up\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. energy landscape is changing rapidly. Federal investments like the Inflation Reduction Act—which dedicates $370 billion to clean energy—are accelerating this shift. But while policymakers debate solutions, **Americans are already forming strong opinions**: 64% view renewable energy positively, and over a third would actively recommend it to others.\\\\n\\\\nThe stakes for businesses are clear. **Our survey highlights three priorities for consumers**:\\\\n\\\\nYounger generations are driving demand, with 36% “very likely” to advocate for renewables. For companies, this isn’t just about ethics—it’s economics. Brands that cut costs, demystify green tech, and highlight environmental benefits **will win trust** in a crowded market.\\\\n\\\\nYes, fossil fuels still dominate 60% of U.S. electricity generation. But public sentiment is shifting faster than infrastructure. Businesses that act on these insights now won’t just follow trends—they’ll set them.\\\\n\\\\n## Elevate Your Consumer Research\\\\n\\\\n## Sign Up For More Like This.\\\\n\\\\nGet our latest articles on consumer insights and marketing strategy, with actionable ideas designed to inspire your next bold move.\\\\n\\\\n## You might also like...\\\\n\\\\n![a woman wearing a feathered garment for Brazil Carnival](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Celebrations-in-Brazil-1080x609.png)\\\\n\\\\n### [The Best Celebrations in Brazil According to Its People](https://standard-insights.com/insights/best-celebrations-in-brazil/)\\\\n\\\\n![AI at Work: Southeast Asia\\'s Perspective](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0-1080x609.png)\\\\n\\\\n### [AI at Work: Southeast Asia’s Perspective](https://standard-insights.com/insights/workplace-automation-southeast-asia/)\\\\n\\\\n![a woman wearing a head scarf looking at a laptop](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Future-Of-Work-Malaysia-1080x609.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### [The Future of Work in Malaysia](https://standard-insights.com/insights/the-future-of-work-in-malaysia/)\\\\n\\\\n## Start your next consumer research\\\\n\\\\nCreate your free account, and use our set of tools to conduct your research easily.\\\\n\\\\n![Standard Insights logo](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Light-Green-250x55-1.webp)\\\\n\\\\nWe’re dusting off the Market Research industry.\"}, {\"title\": \"Understanding domestic consumer attitude and behaviour towards energy ...\", \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002781\", \"content\": \"For domestic heating, heat pumps (Gong et al., 2023), solar thermal panels (\\\\\"Generating renewable electricity, 2023) and energy efficient boilers (Kerr and Winskel, 2022) are observed as key systems for decarbonisation and for domestic energy management, the following tend to be instrumental in harnessing domestic energy demand and home\", \"score\": 0.67988104}, {\"title\": \"PDF\", \"url\": \"https://www.global-climatescope.org/downloads/climatescope-2023-report-en.pdf\", \"content\": \"surveyed with tax incentives in force Tax incentives serve as foundation to renewables deployment Source: BloombergNEF.

Wind and solar, which accounted for 80% of new power generating capacity installed in 2022, now make up an eighth of global generation and more than a quarter of overall capacity. Those are just some of the key findings of the 12th edition of Climatescope, BloombergNEF’s annual assessment of individual markets’ progress in the energy transition. This is the third year the project has covered not only the power sector but transportation and buildings as well.\\\\nClimatescope represents the collective efforts of over 50 BNEF analysts. Each year, these researchers gather detailed data on 140 markets across the globe, including 110 emerging economies and 30 developed ones. This year, Montenegro, Bahrain, Iceland and Venezuela were added to the list. The resulting report assesses macro-level energy transition trends and scores individual markets based on their attractiveness for receiving clean energy capital. Other conclusions from the 2023 edition of Climatescope include: Zero-carbon electricity technologies – including wind, solar, hydropower and nuclear – have now reached 46% of global installed power capacity, up from 33% in 2012. • Meanwhile, fossil fuels’ share of new build capacity slumped to the lowest level ever in 2022, at just 13%, compared to 50% in 2013. Even a resurgence in coal power additions couldn’t halt the slide.\\\\nExecutive summary 75% Share of emerging markets’ power capacity additions that came from solar in 2022 $560 billion Global funding for renewable energy projects in 2022, a record high 93% Share of surveyed emerging markets that have renewable energy targets in force Source: BloombergNEF Share of global power capacity additions, by technology 32% 30% 28% 33% 23% 27% 22% 27% 21% 14% 10% 16% 4% 7% 24% 26% 29% 15% 22% 20% 23% 17% 14% 19% 23% 10% 10% 14% 5% 16% 13% 12% 14% 15% 18% 14% 10% 12% 5% 6% 4% 7% 7% 5% 17% 20% 15% 18% 20% 13% 19% 22% 18% 20% 17% 22% 31% 27% 21% 4% 4% 7% 13% 14% 16% 18% 19% 26% 39% 36% 42% 45% 49% 59% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Coal Natural gas Hydro Wind Solar Nuclear Oil and diesel Biomass and waste Other - fossil 4 November 29, 2023 • Global investment in renewable energy projects hit a record $560 billion in 2022, with small-scale photovoltaic solar accounting for over a fifth of the total. Successful net-metering policies and tax incentives have fueled the sector’s meteoric rise, which attracted twice as much investment in 2022 as two years prior. • Utility-scale solar also had a banner year, accounting for 41% of renewable energy investment last year, beating out wind, which received 36% of the total.\\\\nEmerging markets are becoming increasingly important players in the clean-power space. Of the 341 gigawatts of new wind and solar additions in 2022, some 222 gigawatts were added in developing economies.\\\\n• In most emerging markets, levelized costs of electricity for solar and wind – the long-term offtake price that a power plant needs to break even – have fallen dramatically. That means new solar and wind projects can now build more capacity with less investment. • Out of the 110 emerging markets surveyed in this report, a record 74 had at least 1 megawatt of solar capacity installed last year, compared to just 30 markets a decade ago. • In line with broader global trends, fossil-fuel additions in emerging markets fell to a record low in 2022. • Yet, investment remains concentrated in a handful of emerging economies. Just 15 markets attracted 86% of the $81 billion in clean-energy investments that were directed toward emerging economies (excluding mainland China) last year. Brazil alone received $25 billion, followed by $12 billion for India and $6 billion for South Africa. The list of the top developing-market recipients of clean-energy investment remains essentially unchanged over the past five years. Of the emerging markets surveyed by Climatescope, 93% have renewable energy targets in force. But most still face an uphill battle to achieve these targets. • Around 60% of emerging markets with a clean energy target have yet to meet even the half-way mark of their ambitions, even though most of these goals are due in 2030.\\\\nExecutive summary (2) 5 November 29, 2023 • While these markets have improved their policy books over the years, more – and more effective – policies must still be adopted. Net metering, which is now present in 59% of the emerging markets surveyed, is the policy type that has seen the greatest growth since 2021.\\\\n• Policy is now particularly relevant as world leaders have expressed interest in tripling global installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. According to BNEF’s report Tripling Global Renewables by 2030 (web | terminal), scaling up the right mix of technologies will require measures that address barriers to access, enable competitive auctions and encourage corporate power purchase agreements. India has been among the top five most attractive emerging markets for renewable energy investment since 2018, and this year it returned to the highest position in Climatescope’s ranking of developing economies. Its ambitious policy framework and extremely competitive renewable energy market have attracted around $47 billion of clean energy investment over the past five years. • Mainland China, which continues to play a key role in the global clean energy story, ranked second this year among emerging markets, having accounted for 52% of global investment in 2022. It presents a wealth of opportunities for the global energy transition, since it is estimated that by 2030, some 35% of the world’s installed solar capacity and 50% of wind will be located in the giant Asian market. Chile, which last year stood atop the podium, comes in third, with its well-established clean energy policies, bold targets and overall commitment to greening its grid keeping it in the top three.\\\\n• Fourth place goes to the Philippines, which appears in the top-five list for the first time thanks to its auctions, feed-in tariffs, net-metering schemes, tax incentives and strong targets for renewable energy. Brazil, where the small-scale segment is the main driver of clean energy deployment, comes in fifth.\\\\nGlobal passenger electric vehicle sales hit 10.3 million units in 2022, nearly doubling from 2021. In just six years, the share of EVs in total passenger vehicle sales has jumped more than 10-fold, from 1.4% in 2017 to 15% in 2022. • The 6.1 million EVs sold in mainland China accounted for 60% of the global total in 2022 and nearly 96% of sales in emerging markets. Its cumulative EV sales since 2017 now stand at 13 million, some 4.5 million more than the top 10 developed markets for EVs combined.\\\\nExecutive summary (3) 6 November 29, 2023 • Other emerging markets represent a tiny share of total global EV sales, but their progress should not be overlooked. In 2021, these markets accounted for just 3% of global EV sales, but the number of units sold has nearly doubled for each of the past two years. Electrified heating has gained considerable popularity over the past decade, although sales of heat pumps stalled in 2022, rising only 1% year-on-year, compared to a 7% average compound annual growth rate over the past decade. • Heat pump demand remains dependent on subsidies or other consumer support mechanisms due to high upfront costs, and in many markets the technology struggles to compete with gas-fired boilers. • Government bans on the purchase of certain types of boilers have increased in recent years. Of the 29 markets surveyed by Climatescope, 15 have legislated bans on boilers for one or more technology. (This report was corrected post-publication to fix statements on Slide 70 about Chile’s clean energy targets.)

A deep dive into how surveyed markets are driving the energy transition, it provides snapshots of current clean energy policy and finance conditions that can lead to future capital deployment and project development.\\\\nThis is the 12th edition of Climatescope, and the project has evolved significantly since its launch more than a decade ago. It now includes detailed information on 140 markets, including 110 emerging economies and 30 developed ones. This year, four new markets have been added to the coverage: Bahrain, Iceland, Montenegro and Venezuela. Climatescope’s sectoral coverage has also expanded over the years. While early editions of the report focused on just the power sector, in 2021 we began including in-depth investment condition data for lower-carbon transportation and buildings.\\\\nThe project now encompasses nearly every market in the world*. Developed markets are defined as OECD countries minus Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Turkey. These five are part of the OECD but remain attractive emerging markets for clean energy development. Developing markets include all non-OECD markets, plus these five. Readers are encouraged to explore the complete rankings, datasets, methodology, tools and market profiles on the Climatescope website. 9 November 29, 2023 Renewables take the lead 03.\\\\nPower sector 10 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF.

Zero-carbon technologies consist of renewable sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and small hydro), large hydro and nuclear.\\\\nShare of global generation by technology With nearly 3,500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power produced in 2022, wind and solar accounted for a combined 12.6% of global generation in 2022. Wind’s contribution rose to 8%, up from just 4% six years ago, while solar reached nearly 5%, from less than 1.5% in 2016. Non-hydro renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass) attained 15% of total generation, nearly doubling their 8% share in 2016.\\\\nZero-carbon technologies accounted for 40% of total generation in 2022. Hydro and nuclear represented 15.4% and 9.5% respectively in 2022, but the relative participation of these technologies in the grid has declined over the past decade due to the growing additions of other zero-carbon technologies such as solar and wind. Although fossil fuels still dominate global electricity generation, their share is slowly decreasing. Coal, natural gas, oil and other fossil fuels generated 65% of the world’s electricity at the beginning of the decade and now represent 59%.

Renewable includes wind, solar, biomass and waste, geothermal and hydro technologies.\\\\nGlobal annual generation by technology Total global power production jumped 3.1% in 2022 in midst of the economic recovery from Covid-19 and the European energy crisis. Generation rose from 26,700TWh in 2021 to 27,500TWh in 2022, marking a new high. Renewables accounted for 75% of the total generation change from 2021 to 2022. Renewables (including large hydro) led the growth in total electricity production, with an 8% jump from 2021 to 2022. Total global renewable generation reached its highest level ever in 2022, at 8,400TWh, and represented over 30% of global generation for the first time. Solar accounted for 1,350TWh, and wind 2,100TWh. Fossil fuels remain the main source of electricity generation, at 16,500TWh, or nearly 60% of total power demand. Coal generation reached a new record, generating 9,600TWh in 2022, up 7% compared with 2020 and 2% from 2021. Natural gas topped 6,200TWh, a rise of 3% from 2021. Meanwhile, oil generation slid 6% in 2022, compared with a 3% increase from 2020 to 2021.\\\\nRenewables led the upsurge in global generation 8.6 8.8 9.1 8.9 8.9 9.0 9.3 9.3 8.9 9.4 9.6 5.0 4.9 5.0 5.3 5.5 5.6 5.8 6.0 5.9 6.0 6.2 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.8 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.2 4.2 4.2 2.5 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.8 2.6 1.6 1.9 2.1 1.1 1.4 21.7 22.0 22.7 23.1 23.7 24.2 25.1 25.7 25.6 26.7 27.5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thousand terawatt-hours Coal Natural gas Hydro Nuclear Wind Solar Biomass and waste Oil and diesel Other - fossil Geothermal Marine 12 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF.

Three main factors explain renewables becoming the most pragmatic option: fast-growing post-pandemic electricity demand overall, a jump in coal and natural gas prices, and lower renewable levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs). Although coal generation grew less in 2022 than it did in 2021, it still saw a considerable increase, reaching 209TWh on a year-on-year change basis. This surge is backed by China, India and Europe. Thanks to energy security concerns, coal was brought back into power systems.\\\\nWind and solar generation thrive amid the global energy crisis 385 132 326 -212 140 316 -347 451 209 197 134 115 128 94 50 96 -79 224 -105 95 349 160 76 233 189 -97 157 -230 79 -79 94 -131 118 133 134 163 201 271 92 107 66 120 135 178 126 173 168 265 243 -750 -500 -250 0 250 500 750 1,000 1,250 1,500 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Terawatt-hours Wind Solar Other - fossil Oil and diesel Nuclear Natural Gas Hydro Geothermal Coal Biomass and waste 13 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF. ‘Other - fossil’ accounts for plants that use more than one fuel or fuels other than coal, oil, gas, hydro and nuclear. Global installed capacity by technology Global installed power-generating capacity reached a new high of 8.3 terawatts (TW) in 2022, representing a year-on-year growth of over 5% from 2021 to 2022. Global installed capacity in 2022 also represented a growth of over 50% from the 5.4TW installed 10 years ago. Wind and solar accounted for over a quarter of global capacity for the first time in 2022. Together, these technologies represented nearly 26% of global capacity as of year-end 2022. Zero-carbon technologies reached 46% of global capacity, up from 33% in 2012. Wind and solar saw the fastest growth of any type of generation. Solar capacity in 2022 jumped 20% from the year prior, to 1,228 gigawatts (GW) – more than 11 times the 101GW that was online in 2012 and 176 times the 6GW that was installed in 2006. Global wind capacity bounced 10% over 2021-2022 to reach 930GW, tripling in a decade. Coal still accounts for the largest individual share of global capacity, with 2.2TW, or 26% of the global power matrix. Online coal capacity continues to rise in absolute numbers even as its share on a percentage basis declines.

Share of global capacity additions by technology New power-generating capacity added globally reached a record 424GW in 2022, with solar and wind accounting for 80% of the total. This was up 14% from 371GW in 2021, and up more than 80% compared with the 231GW added in 2012.\\\\nSolar accounted for 59% of all capacity added, followed by wind, at 21%. Solar photovoltaic (PV) additions in 2022 were nearly 40% higher than in 2021. Wind capacity additions dropped by 10% compared with 2021, held back by challenges around permitting, interconnection, supply chains and profitability. Supply chain bottlenecks have limited late-stage project deployment as well as rising costs for developers.\\\\nRenewables (including hydro) encompassed 86% of total capacity additions in 2022. This was up from just 52% in 2012. Coal’s contribution to year-on-year growth rebounded to 7%. Natural gas accounted for 5% of new capacity in 2022, down from 14% in 2021.

Mainland China alone added 107GW in 2022, or 42% of total additions. Mainland China and the US accounted for half of global capacity added over 2013-2022, while also being the top two markets for solar additions over the past decade.\\\\nNew solar markets are emerging quickly as enabling policy frameworks improve. Brazil, India and Vietnam are developing economies where solar has boomed in recent years. India’s auctions, Brazil net metering policy and Vietnam’s feed-in tariff were the main policy instruments that helped kick-start these economies’ solar markets. Despite these efforts, these markets represented only 11% of solar additions in 2022.\\\\nTop 10 markets for solar capacity additions, 2022 Top 10 markets for solar capacity additions, 2013-2022 Mainland China installed 42% of total solar additions in 2022 Source: BloombergNEF.

Yet, the market installed 32% less in 2022 than in 2021. The UK followed, with 3GW installed in 2022, representing 4% of all wind capacity added in the year. Excluding mainland China, Brazil and India led wind additions in developing markets over 2013-2022. Together, they accounted for 7% of the global cumulative installed capacity. Brazil saw a greater-than-sevenfold increase, and India accounted for over 22GW added over that same period.\\\\nTop 10 markets for wind capacity additions, 2022 Top 10 markets for wind capacity additions, 2013-2022 Some 85% of wind capacity additions are concentrated in 10 economies Source: BloombergNEF.

Natural gas led this drop, sliding to 23GW added in 2022 compared with 53GW in 2021. Coal was the top fossil fuel added in 2022, accounting for a net growth of 30GW; that addition represents a steep drop from the 70GW added in 2013 but a resurgence from net-negative figures in 2021.\\\\nLed by wind and solar, renewables now represent 87% of net capacity additions. Solar saw a 252GW addition in 2022, more than double the capacity added in 2019. Despite changes in tax incentives and policies, as well as commodity inflation and supply chain issues worldwide, solar remains one of the cheapest new-build technologies for producing electricity in economies that make up two-thirds of world population and three-quarters of global GDP.\\\\nGlobal share of net capacity additions Global year-on-year capacity change Globally, fossil fuels’ net capacity additions dropped to their lowest level ever Source: BloombergNEF.

Fossil fuels’ net additions in developed economies shrank in 2022, totaling just 6% of new build, compared with 8% in 2021 and 28% in 2017. Natural gas accounted for just 4GW, compared with 21GW in 2018.\\\\nDeveloped markets saw coal retirements slow down in 2022. As Europe struggled with droughts and gas supply cuts from Russia, coal has turned into a short-term crutch to meet energy needs. As result, many economies have delayed coal phase-out plans and even restarted capacity that had been mothballed. Across all technologies, a record near-110GW of renewable capacity was added in developed markets in 2022. Solar leads with 77GW, while wind was the second-most-added technology, at 31GW.

This is the biggest increase in coal net additions since 2019, when it accounted for 60GW. This is mainly attributed to mainland China, which added 33GW of coal capacity in 2022 alone. After a rise in 2021, net additions from natural gas dropped to 19GW in 2022, down from 45GW the year prior. With solar and wind taking the lead, developing markets have added more capacity than ever. These markets saw 13% growth in net additions in one year, to 310GW in 2022. Solar added a record 164GW, 57% more than in 2021.

Note: Data considers only 140 markets covered by Climatescope. Markets with at least 1 megawatt installed per year, 2013-2022 In 2022, at least 101 markets installed at least 1 megawatt (MW) of solar capacity – a new high. This figure is nearly double the 53 markets that did so in 2013. The modular nature of PV, along with steep equipment price declines over the course of the past decade, explain the technology’s proliferation.\\\\nHydro saw 47 markets adding over 1MW in 2022, the highest number in the last three years and four more than in 2021. Wind, on the other hand, dropped to 42 markets adding at least 1MW, compared to 48 in 2021. Coal saw an uptick in markets that installed at least 1MW of this technology in 2022, while oil plummeted to its lowest level since at least 2013 and natural gas kept stable. Despite the drop, oil was the fossil fuel technology installed in the greatest number of markets (38), followed by gas (35) and coal (14).\\\\nSolar is by far the most popular technology added worldwide 53 101 42 35 47 38 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Solar Wind Natural gas Hydro Oil and diesel Coal Number of markets 21 November 29, 2023 Solar and wind now have the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of any technology. Solar and wind LCOEs increased slightly in 2021 and 2022, due to a rise in commodity and freight prices and higher interest rates imposed by central banks, yet fossil fuels saw their costs rise even further. Solar modules and wind turbine installations are intensifying as equipment costs fall. This year, solar module prices hit an all-time low, decreasing capital expenditures – or the sum of development, equipment and construction costs – for PV projects. This means that each dollar invested can support more capacity.\\\\nSince 2022, renewables have become cheaper than coal even in Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines. For the first time ever, building an offshore wind project is roughly the same price on average as building a coal-fired power plant – and cheaper than building one fired by gas. Offshore wind and coal now boast an LCOE of $74 per megawatt-hour (MWh), compared with $92/GW for natural gas. In markets representing 60% of global electricity generation, it is now cheaper to build solar and wind power plants than to keep running existing plants fired by gas and coal.\\\\nGlobal wind capacity and investment 2018-2022 Global solar capacity and investment 2018-2022 As capex costs for renewables fall, each dollar invested has a greater impact Source: BloombergNEF.

Clean energy investment almost doubled from 2018 to 2022, with mainland China accounting for the largest share of investment post-2020, with 52% in 2022. Wind and solar reached new highs in 2022, together accounting for 98% of the year’s renewable energy investment. Solar alone represented 63% of the total. Investment in utility-scale solar projects saw a 38% increase from 2021 to 2022, while wind increased 4% over the same period.\\\\nFor the first time since 2018, utility-scale photovoltaic solar (PV) raked in more than wind, with $230 billion – or 41% of global renewable energy investment – in 2022. Wind received nearly 36% of global investment, or $199 billion. Small-scale PV projects came in third, with 21%, while other renewables together accounted for the remaining 2%.\\\\nInvestment in small-scale PV projects soared to a record high in 2022, growing 57% year-on-year and more than tripling compared to 2018. This growth was mainly driven by net-metering and tax incentive policies in key emerging markets.

In 2022, the top 15 emerging markets (excluding mainland China) for new-build clean energy investment attracted $70 billion, or 87% of all investment in emerging markets. The list remains largely unchanged from the top 15 markets for cumulative renewable energy investment over 2017-2021, although in 2022 Uzbekistan, the Philippines, Colombia and Saudi Arabia edged out Ukraine, Argentina, Russia and Morocco. Investment in renewable energy skyrocketed in Brazil in 2022, when the market attracted $25 billion – compared with a cumulative $41 billion over the five preceding years. This jump was mainly thanks to a successful net-metering policy aligned with tax incentives benefitting small-scale PV projects, which attracted $13 billion in 2022, the same amount the technology had received over 2017-2021 combined. Furthermore, Brazil attracted the third-highest investment in renewables globally, behind only mainland China and the US.

Among the 15 developed and emerging markets that finished at the top of the Climatescope scoring table, the average cumulative investment over the last five years was $24 billion. Meanwhile, the 15 markets that finished at the bottom of the ranking averaged $291 million. Comparing countries’ policy scores with levels of attracted investment reveals the key role policies can play in mobilizing capital. Difficulty in diversifying investment across emerging markets is directly linked to the absence of environments conducive to attracting such investments. Having effective policies and a mature, transparent power market that is open to private players, for example, renders a market more attractive to clean energy investment.\\\\nPolicy plays a major role in clean energy investment and deployment Source: BloombergNEF, Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

Due to an increase in the adoption of these targets, only 7% of the continent’s markets have no clean energy policy in force; one year ago this share was of 12%. Nevertheless, many markets in the region have yet to implement the necessary policies that would propel their power sectors toward a cleaner and more sustainable future. Among regions, Africa has the lowest adoption of other kinds of renewable energy policies, and only 24% of its markets have at least three mechanism in force. In Europe, more than a third of emerging markets have at least four clean power policies in force, the largest share of any region. All markets in the Asia-Pacific region have renewables targets, and 36% have at least three policies in place, while in the Middle East, 60% of markets have three policies on the books. And more than half of the markets in Latin America have two policies, often a renewable energy target and an auction or net-metering policy.\\\\nShare of emerging markets in each region with a specific number of policy mechanisms in force Policy adoption rates vary widely by region Source: BloombergNEF.

Note: Includes 110 emerging markets surveyed through the end of July 2023.\\\\nEmerging markets with auctions, feed-in tariffs or both Reverse auctions for clean power delivery contracts and feed-in tariffs have proved to be two of the more effective policies for spurring renewable energy build. As of 2023, 63 of the 110 emerging markets surveyed in this report have auction mechanisms, while 32 have feed-in tariffs. Twenty markets have both.\\\\nAmong regions, emerging Europe has the highest share – 77% – of developing countries with such policies. In Latin America, auctions are the most popular mechanism for enabling the development of renewables; these are present in more than half of the region’s markets.\\\\nAfrican markets were initially slow to adopt these policies but have recently made significant strides: now, almost half have auctions in place. The adoption of such policies has helped support clean energy investment and capacity deployment across the continent. More than half of emerging markets conduct auctions for renewable energy contracts 27 November 29, 2023 In 2023, 93% of the emerging markets covered by Climatescope have renewable energy targets in place. This represents a leap of 11 percentage points in just two years. Renewable energy targets are by far the most popular type of policy, but most of these markets lack the mechanisms to help deliver them.\\\\nReverse auctions for clean power delivery contracts and net metering to support rooftop solar are also rapidly gaining traction. In 2023, 57% of markets surveyed had auction policies in force, compared to 49% in 2021. Net metering is now present in 59% of emerging markets, compared to 49% in 2021, and the growth of this kind of incentive is helping distributed solar spread to more markets.\\\\nFeed-in tariffs are the only type of policy losing ground. In 2023, they are available in 28% of emerging markets, compared with 30% in 2022. The reasons for renouncing an incentive may vary. While it’s common to move from feed-in tariffs to reverse auctions, retroactive changes may happen due to regulatory issues or governmental changes.\\\\nShare of emerging markets surveyed where key renewable power policies are present, 2021-2023 Clean power policies have made progress in emerging markets – but are still not on track for meeting targets Source: BloombergNEF.

Parameters are: up to 20% - Small, 20% - 50% - Medium, over 50% - Large. ‘Not applicable’ indicates the target has already been achieved, or the market does not have a target in force.\\\\nGap to achieving renewable energy targets in emerging markets The last decade was marked by notable surges in climate ambitions, with markets consistently improving their renewable energy targets and pledging to accelerate carbon emission reductions. Currently, the majority of emerging markets covered by Climatescope have such targets. The increased rate of these policies’ adoption can be attributed mainly to international commitments and the pressure imposed by events such as the Conference of the Parties (COP).\\\\nHowever, among the markets that have a renewable energy target in force, almost 60% have yet to meet even the half-way mark, even though most of these goals are set to come due in 2030. Governments must thus balance ambition with feasibility when it comes to setting targets. Achieving targets also requires setting effective policies, such as tax incentives, auctions, feed-in tariffs and net metering.\\\\nStrong renewable energy targets signal ambition – but not always effectiveness 29 November 29, 2023 Tax incentives are another important measure adopted mainly in emerging markets. Governments in these markets use tax reductions or exemptions in order to attract project developers and subsidize upfront costs.\\\\nThe most common type of tax incentive in the emerging markets surveyed by Climatescope is an import tax, which is available in 59% of the 110 markets. Value-added tax (VAT) exemptions/reductions, present in 55%, come in a close second. Accelerated depreciation – by which renewable energy asset book values decrease at a faster rate than they would using traditional depreciation methods – is the least common, but still present in 25% of the emerging markets. 2023 share of emerging markets surveyed with tax incentives in force Tax incentives serve as foundation to renewables deployment Source: BloombergNEF.

This marks an all-time high, and a jump of 10 percentage points from the 20% share in 2012. In absolute numbers, G-20 economies saw renewable generation almost double over the last decade, from 3,300TWh in 2012 to 6,500TWh in 2022.\\\\nAmong G-20 economies, only Brazil and Canada have more than 60% of their generation coming from renewable energy sources; in both cases, the high share is thanks to large hydro fleets. The other 17 economies are still lagging when it comes to adding more renewables to the grid and meeting their often-ambitious renewable energy targets.\\\\nSaudi Arabia, South Africa and South Korea are still falling behind most of their peers. Such markets are highly reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generation and have a long way to go to be on track to meet their 2050 net-zero pledges.\\\\nBrazil has one of the world’s cleanest energy matrixes. This is mainly attributable to its natural resources, especially hydro power. In 2022, renewable generation in Brazil reached an all-time high thanks to abundant rainfall and solar and wind installed capacity growth as a result of effective policies and incentives.\\\\n88% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Brazil Canada Germany Turkey UK Argentina Italy Mainland China Australia Mexico France Japan US Indonesia Russia India South Korea South Africa Saudi Arabia 35 November 29, 2023 Middle East Africa Latin America North America and Caribbean Europe Asia Pacific Installed capacity additions by region and technology, 2018-2022 Source: BloombergNEF.

As of year-end 2022, APAC had 4.1TW installed, with mainland China alone accounting for 30% of the global total. Mainland China’s capacity has more than doubled over the decade, from 1.1TW in 2012 to 2.5TW in 2022. All regions broadly held their respective shares from 2021 to 2022. Europe remaining the second largest region for installed capacity with 20% of the global share, followed by North America at 17%. However, these are the only two regions that have seen a sharp drop in their capacity shares since 2006, when each accounted for around 26% of global capacity. This is mainly attributed to the steep increase in mainland China’s installed capacity. Despite being home to around 16% of the world’s population, Africa has just 3% of installed global capacity.

The % change in global installed capacity by region refers to the 2012-2022 period.\\\\nGlobal installed capacity by region APAC’s total installed capacity has nearly doubled in a decade. Capacity jumped from 2.1TW in 2012 to 4.1TW in 2022. In absolute terms, mainland China, India and Japan led the region’s growth, accounting for 1,729GW added in the last decade. Ambitious deployment goals and enabling policy frameworks have allowed APAC to consistently expand the deployment of renewables.\\\\nAfrica followed, with a 67% jump over the same period. In 2022, the continent reached 237GW of capacity, up from 121GW in 2012. Egypt, South Africa and Algeria are among the African markets that saw their installed capacity grow most over the period, together adding nearly 57GW in a decade. Europe and North America have grown least since 2012. These regions each saw their power matrix grow by just 20%. However, despite the European energy crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war, Europe saw a slight increase in installed capacity in 2022. In North America, the uptake was mainly led by the US with the establishment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which will kickstart an upsurge of renewables.\\\\nAfrica has seen the fastest capacity growth in the past 10 years +45% +55% +19% +97% +20% +67% 2.1 2.3 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.7 0.5 0.3 0.2 5.4 5.7 5.9 6.2 6.5 6.7 7.0 7.3 7.6 8.0 8.4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Terawatts Africa Middle East Latin America Europe North America and Caribbean Asia-Pacific 38 November 29, 2023 Additions by technology Renewable additions by economy The G-20 represents 86% of global installed capacity additions Source: BloombergNEF.

Coal is still the main source of power production in APAC, due mainly to extensive coal reserves in mainland China and India.\\\\nApart from coal, fossil fuels’ installed capacity additions have remained relatively stable. In the last three years, fossil fuels have risen an average of 2% yearly, with coal accounting for 60% of the fossil fuel additions.\\\\nAPAC holds the biggest coal reserves in the world. However, despite renewable energy goals, coal phase-out targets in the region’s main economies are still far away. APAC’s total installed capacity is heavily concentrated in five markets. Mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea and Australia account for 89% of the region’s power matrix, at a combined capacity of 3.5TW.\\\\nSolar additions reached a new high of 47GW in 2022.

Inadequate regulatory support, lack of EV models, high upfront costs, the popularity of used cars and sparse charging infrastructure are all to blame.\\\\nOn average, developed markets’ EV share of sales was nearly 17%, 17 times higher than the figure registered for emerging economies. Despite the huge gap between those numbers, both developed and developing markets are progressing at roughly the same rate, with average EV share of total sales growing 40-fold in both cases since 2016.\\\\nThe EV adoption gap between developed and developing markets is wide Source: BloombergNEF.

Some 93% of developed markets surveyed by Climatescope have clean transport targets on the books. In emerging markets, the total is just 32%, although this represents a 10-percentage-point increase over last year’s figure.\\\\nDirect purchase incentives, which lower the upfront costs of buying EVs, are effective at kick-starting markets, but are still limited to a small share of developing economies. Such subsidies are expensive for governments and thus harder to introduce. They typically include EV purchase incentives, and income/import tax reductions. Import tax incentives are the first to be embraced by emerging markets. Duty taxes in emerging markets usually hold a considerable share of the final cost for consumers, as most of these markets are not vehicle makers and have to import them.\\\\nShare of Climatescope markets with clean-transport policies in place Import tax exemption for EVs is the most popular policy in emerging markets Source: BloombergNEF, Climatescope.

ICE phase-out targets by market Some 37 central governments have set dates to eliminate sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Another 34 regional and municipal authorities have such goals in force. The European Commission’s proposal to phase out ICE vehicle sales in the EU by 2035 adds another 11 markets to the former list. Regional and state-level ICE phase-out targets matter. Even targets that affect smaller geographical regions can signal to automakers and consumers the need to shift to zero-emission vehicles, especially in areas where market-wide mandates have yet to be implemented. Progress in setting ICE phase-out targets is slow in emerging markets. Of the five emerging markets with the biggest vehicle fleets – mainland China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand, which together represented nearly 45% of global passenger vehicle sales in 2022 – only Mexico has an ICE phase-out on the books. This policy applies only to Mexico City, and it aims to ban ICE vehicles in 2040.

An additional 16 markets have regional or provincial targets on the books.\\\\nGlobal e-bus sales are growing briskly, largely thanks to mainland China. E-buses accounted for 40% of all new bus sales globally in 2022, according to BNEF’s Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook 2023. E-bus sales are also growing in Latin America and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. Chile and Colombia combined accounted for 98% of Latin America’s e-bus sales and 2% of global sales in 2022.

Note: Data for Mainland China only available from 2016.\\\\nHeat pump sales by market Even though the popularity of electrified heat has grown over the past decade as countries seek lower-carbon solutions for boosting building temperatures, heat pump sales in 2022 stalled compared to the year prior. Heat pump sales rose only 1% from 2021 to 2022, to reach to 11 million units sold. That’s 7 percentage points less that the average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2012. In addition, heat pumps remain concentrated in just five markets – the US, Japan, mainland China, France and Italy – which together accounted for 81% of 2022 sales. Gas heating is typically cheaper than heat pumps for European households. However, the recent global energy crisis and subsequent volatility in electricity and gas prices have boosted heat pump sales, as have targeted subsidies.\\\\nWhen compared to traditional electric heaters, heat pump uptake usually leads to reduced energy consumption, as the technology produces two to three times more heat using the same amount of electricity.

Low-carbon heat targets or roadmaps, which are in place in 76% of covered markets, are a close second. Tax credits and boiler scrappage are also relatively popular, with roughly 50% of markets using these to support heat pump adoption.\\\\nGovernment bans on the purchase of certain boilers have also grown in recent years. No fewer than 15 countries have announced bans set to be in force by 2030. However, due to high upfront costs, heat pump demand remains quite dependent on subsidies or other consumer-support mechanisms, and in many markets the technology still struggles to compete with gas-fired boilers.\\\\nHeat pump incentives and low-carbon heat targets are the most popular policies surveyed 38% 48% 48% 52% 76% 83% Ban on boilers/all homes Ban on boilers/new-build homes Boiler scrappage schemes Tax credits Low-carbon heat target/roadmap/strategy Heat pumps purchase grants/loans incentives 64 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF. Note: Countries with bans planned in more than one technology are counted twice.\\\\nMarkets with boiler bans in force, by technology type Government bans on the purchase of certain types of boilers have increased in recent years. Out of the 29 markets surveyed by Climatescope, 15 have legislated bans on boilers for one or more type of fuel.\\\\nBans on boilers are somewhat balanced among the different technologies. Thirteen markets have bans on gas and oil boilers scheduled to come into force in or before 2030, while eleven markets plan coal boiler bans by then. These bans are typically guided by a combination of cost and environmental factors, including goals to phase out fossil-fuel-intensive heating systems.\\\\nIn 14 of the markets surveyed, boiler bans affect only new buildings, exempting most of the existing housing stock, while 11 markets have announced bans that will apply to all existing homes.\\\\nGovernments lean on boiler bans in new homes 13 13 11 Gas Oil Coal 65 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF Number of markets with energy performance standards in force Energy efficiency measures An enabling environment is necessary for smoothing the transition to clean heating Energy efficiency measures and performance standards are conventional steps for transitioning to a cleaner building environment. These standards determine a maximum acceptable level for buildings’ final energy use. Where such policies are in place, building assessments, conducted by verified assessors at a set frequency, are usually mandatory. While performance standards are not new, they are becoming much more common, especially for newly built structures. Out of the 29 markets surveyed, only 18 had a standard in force in or before 2015; five years later, that number had risen to 27.\\\\nEnergy efficiency strategies and financial incentives help move a market’s building stock toward better efficiency ratings. These strategies typically include policy support for improving insulation and draft-proofing, upgrading or changing to more efficient types of heating and fitting new heat controls, among other measures. While 97% of the surveyed markets have energy efficiency ambitions, just 72% actually provide grants to support them. Loans are an even less common option, with only 45% of markets using this approach.\\\\n1 4 18 27 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Before 1995 1996-2005 2006-2015 2016-2020 Number of countries with policy in force in each period 66 November 29, 2023 06.\\\\nResults: Power sector 67 November 29, 2023 Climatescope considers over 100 indicators across three parameters – fundamentals, opportunities and experience – to asses markets’ relative attractiveness for renewable energy investment.

India boasts the largest and most competitive auctions in the world, as well as one of the world’s highest renewable energy targets: 175GW by March 2022, and 500GW by 2030. As of year-end 2022, installed renewables capacity had reached 140GW – made up of 78GW of solar, 41GW of wind and 21GW from other clean sources excluding large hydro – or 80% of the 175GW goal. Since 2017, capacity additions from renewables have exceeded those of coal.\\\\nIndia’s position in the Climatescope ranking mainly reflects its fundamentals. Since 2012, it has implemented specific and efficient policies such as auctions, renewable energy targets and feed-in tariffs. These transparent mechanisms and ambitious government targets have attracted many domestic and foreign players, garnering around $47 billion in clean energy investment over the past five years.\\\\n1.

While it comes in second overall this year, it boasts the top score for Opportunities, a reflection of its massive potential for growth. We expect that by 2030, 35% of the world’s installed solar capacity and 50% of wind will have originated in the Asian giant. At the end of 2022, mainland China had 440GW of solar and 393GW of wind online, representing 33% of total installed capacity.\\\\nHowever, coal still dominates mainland China’s power system and accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in 2022. Currently, 64% of the market’s generation comes from thermal sources, with coal alone accounting for almost 60% of that figure. Mainland China attracted 78% of emerging markets’ clean energy asset investment last year. Among top five markets on the Climatescope ranking, Mainland China attracted almost seven times as much as the four other markets together.\\\\n2. Mainland China Source: BloombergNEF.

Moreover, significant volumes of renewable energy investment have helped make Chile attractive to clean energy investors. The market has already achieved its 20%-by-2025 target for clean power generation well in advance of the deadline, and the government is now discussing implementing a bolder target of 60% clean power generation in the upcoming years. While 44% of Chile’s generation currently comes from thermal sources, the market has committed to shuttering 1.7GW of coal-fired power by 2025 and completely phasing out coal by 2040. At the end of 2022, Chile had 7.3GW of solar and 3.9GW of wind online, representing 35% of its total installed capacity. Chile has attracted around $16 billion of clean energy investment over the past five years. This is mainly due to its well-structured power sector, which allows developers to sign bilateral contracts with large customers outside the regulated market, among other benefits.\\\\n3.

The market stands out as one of the few that have implemented auctions, feed-in tariffs, net-metering schemes, tax incentives and a strong target for renewable energy. In its second green energy auction, the Philippines awarded 3.4GW of renewable capacity out of the 11.6GW offered. From this, 1.2GW is earmarked for 2024-25 and will target ground-mounted and rooftop solar and onshore wind, and 2.2GW is earmarked for 2026. Currently, around 18% of the market’s total installed capacity comes from renewables, with wind accounting for 8%. The Philippines’ release of an offshore wind roadmap and no foreign ownership restrictions have encouraged growth in offshore wind investment.

The region is home to 4.1 terawatts (TW) – or nearly 50% – of the world’s total installed capacity, with renewables accounting for 1.2TW in 2022. The top five Asian markets account for 82% of the region’s total capacity. Asian governments raised their climate ambitions in 2022, with more funding and new schemes for renewables. For the first time, all Asian markets had established renewable energy targets last year. Vietnam, for example, is set to surpass Indonesia to become Southeast Asia’s leader in renewables capacity. In 2021, Vietnam’s prime announced a 2050 net-zero target at COP26 that remains the most advanced climate commitment in Southeast Asia.\\\\nIn 2022, the region attracted $319 billion, or 86% of emerging markets’ renewables investment.

Despite encompassing the largest number of emerging markets within a region, Africa has no entries among the top 15. This is mainly due to the lack of supportive policies and well-structured, reliable power markets.\\\\nHowever, the region still boasts the highest scores for the Opportunities parameter, with four of the top 10 markets by this ranking. With 63% of Africa’s installed capacity coming from fossil fuels, the continent has a long way to go to transition to a cleaner economy.

Building thermal power plants in the Middle East remains far cheaper than building renewables, meaning the region would have to invest massively to transition to a cleaner economy. The Middle East also has the lowest average electricity prices in the world, further hindering the deployment of renewables projects. However, this picture is slowly changing, as countries set ambitious targets for renewable energy.\\\\nDespite bold targets and new policies, the region saw renewable energy investment fall from 2021 to 2022.

The escalating global population coupled with ongoing technological advancements perpetuates the surge in energy requirements (Kwon et al., 2016, Stringer et al., 2024). Projections indicate an annual growth rate in energy demand of approximately 1.8% by 2030. As of 2019, conventional fossil fuels have predominated as the primary source, accounting for over 80% of the global aggregate of primary energy consumption (Çakır, 2023, Tselika, 2022). However, the pervasive reliance on fossil fuel reserves engenders ecological concerns epitomized by phenomena such as global warming and the concomitant emission of greenhouse gases, exacerbating the specter of environmental degradation and precipitating significant proportions of energy conundrum significant proportions (Ukoba et al., 2024a).\\\\n\\\\nIn 2023, the global landscape of renewable energy was poised for a remarkable surge, with capacity additions projected to escalate substantially by 107 GW. This anticipated augmentation marks the most considerable absolute increase ever recorded, propelling the cumulative renewable capacity to surpass 440 GW (Joshi, 2021, Pata et al., 2024). To contextualize this surge, this figure illustrates the combined installed power capacities of both Germany and Spain. This unprecedented upswing reveals its impetus for multiple converging factors. First, expanding policy frameworks dedicated to renewable energy adoption serves as pivotal catalysts, fostering an environment conducive to its proliferation. Concurrently, mounting concerns regarding energy security, coupled with continuous improvement in the cost-competitiveness of renewable energy vis-à-vis fossil fuel alternatives, have contributed significantly to this trajectory (Nassar et al., 2024a, Nassar et al., 2024b, Puertas and Marti, 2022). These affirmative drivers eclipse the challenges posed by factors, such as escalating interest rates, heightened investment costs, and persistent hurdles within the renewable energy supply chain, ensuring the sustained momentum of this burgeoning sector (Khaleel et al., 2023a, Ntanos et al., 2018).\\\\n\\\\nIn an accelerated scenario, global renewable capacity additions are expected to surge, potentially reaching 550 GW by 2024. This forecast represents an approximately 20% increase compared with the projections outlined in the main forecast (Franke et al., 2024, Moriarty and Honnery, 2019, Zsiborács et al., 2019). The primary driving force behind this heightened trajectory is the expedited deployment of residential and commercial photovoltaic (PV) installations. This phenomenon is predicated on the assumption of a more rapid implementation of recent policies and incentives aimed at bolstering the adoption of renewable energy. The magnitude of expansion for utility-scale onshore wind and solar PV projects is contingent upon several key factors (Alasali et al., 2023, Blaabjerg and Ionel, 2015, Maruvala et al., 2024; Mohamed & Elbar, 2024), notably the expeditious processing of permitting procedures, timely execution of construction activities, and prompt integration of these projects into the existing grid infrastructure (Kabalci, 2024, Khaleel, 2023; Khaleel et al., 2022).\\\\n\\\\nThe anticipated augmentation of China\\'s contribution to global renewable capacity additions in the upcoming years, notably in 2023 and 2024, signifies a further consolidation of its paramount position as the foremost leader in worldwide deployment. By 2022, China will substantially dominate the landscape, accounting for nearly half of all newly installed renewable power capacities across the globe (Fu et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023). By the projected timeline of 2024, China\\'s commanding presence is poised to burgeon an unprecedented 55% share of the annual global renewable capacity deployment. China is slated to spearhead the majority of new offshore wind initiatives on a global scale, with an estimated contribution of nearly 70%. Additionally, the nation is anticipated to oversee more than 60% of onshore wind projects and approximately 50% of solar PV ventures by the same year (Ding, 2023, Hu et al., 2023, Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2023; Xin-gang & Ying, 2022).\\\\n\\\\nAccording to projections outlined in the 1.5°C scenario (Ding et al., 2023, Keyßer and Lenzen, 2021), the global aggregate of installed renewable power generation capacity is anticipated to undergo a substantial expansion by 2030, necessitating a more than three-fold increase from the 2022 figure of 3 382 GW to 11 174 GW. Specifically, the augmentation entails a marked rise in installed solar PV capacity, poised to exceed 5 400 GW, and a significant surge from the 2022 capacity of 1 055 GW. Additionally, wind installations are expected to surpass 3 500 GW, comprising 3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore, reflecting a notable increase from 2022 to 899 GW (Aghahosseini et al., 2018, Chuang et al., 2019, Dadashi et al., 2022).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the proportion of variable renewable energy (VRE), including solar PV and wind power, in electricity generation is projected to increase from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021 to 46% by 2030, thereby necessitating enhanced flexibility in the operational dynamics of the energy system. Beyond solar PV and wind power, the third largest upsurge in generation capacity is envisaged for hydropower (Aghahosseini et al., 2017, Knopf et al., 2015, Ram et al., 2018). By the year 2030, the global installed hydropower capacity is forecasted to expand by nearly 17% from the 2022 benchmark, reaching 1 465 GW under the ambit of the 1.5°C scenario. Fig. 1 demonstrates the global capacity for renewable electricity generation under the 1.5°C scenario, specifically for the years 2022-30, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nIt is imperative that there be an accelerated expansion of renewable power generation capacity, encompassing both grid-connected and off-grid systems, particularly within the developing world (Khaleel et al., 2025; Khaleel et al., 2023; Elweddad et al., 2022; Gui et al., 2024).\\\\n\\\\nOne significant contribution of this study is its comprehensive analysis and forecasting of renewable energy generation trends. By examining past developments and current trajectories, this article sheds light on the evolving landscape of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, and hydrogen. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors driving the global growth of renewable energy generation, including technological advancements, policy frameworks, market dynamics, and environmental considerations.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the paper draws on various sources, including government reports, industry publications, and academic studies, to provide insights into the trajectory of renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass. It highlights the trends and predictions that shape the landscape of renewable energy generation worldwide. By synthesizing information and presenting detailed regional breakdowns in capacity growth, electricity demand trends, hydrogen capacity, and integration challenges, this study offers insights into how renewable energy trends manifest differently across various parts of the world. This detailed regional analysis contributes to the positioning of this manuscript within the broader literature on renewable energy forecasting and trends.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the article offers predictions for future trends in renewable energy generation, allowing policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers to anticipate and prepare for future developments. These predictions can serve as a guide for decision-making processes related to energy planning, investment strategies, and sustainable development initiatives.\\\\n\\\\nThis article comprehensively explores the dynamics of renewable energy.

The transition from conventional to renewable energy technology offers the optimal alternative solution to alleviate this significant issue. However, successful adoption of these technologies heavily depends on the consumers\\' willingness. This study aims to evaluate the factors influencing consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty. Additionally, this study added a further novel factor (crime concern) with the existing factors (belief about renewable technology benefits expectation, renewable energy technology cost, environmental concern, subjective norms) to the extended theory of planned behavior. The analysis confirmed that consumers\\' strong belief system, environmental concerns and subjective norms positively impact the consumers\\' willingness to adopt reliable and affordable renewable energy. Cost and crime concern negatively influence consumers\\' willingness to use this optimal technology. Interestingly, the findings of this study indicate that the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies has a notable impact on alleviating energy poverty. This study provides significant insights for governments, renewable energy technology manufacturers, and other relevant stakeholders to enhance the widespread uptake of renewable energy technology among consumers to achieve sustainable energy development goals in the context of energy poverty alleviation.\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nEnergy is a fundamental component of our universe; however, energy poverty is a prevalent environmental issue on a global scale. To mitigate its adverse effects, governments are implementing eco-friendly technologies worldwide \\\\\\\\[1\\\\\\\\]. The continuous growth in population and globalization has led to an escalation in energy demand \\\\\\\\[2\\\\\\\\]. Despite significant technological advancements, many countries continue to rely exclusively on crude oil as a primary source of electricity generation. The persistent utilization of conventional energy for electricity production is a critical component contributing to global warming \\\\\\\\[3\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nEnergy poverty depict the lack of clean and affordable energy access \\\\\\\\[4\\\\\\\\]. This issue has grabbed the predominant attention during the last few decades due to harmful effects on the environment and society \\\\\\\\[5\\\\\\\\]. Tanveer et al. (2021) evaluated that to mitigate the impact of global warming, the worldwide community needs to shift toward renewable and sustainable sources of energy. Renewable energy, such as biogas and solar power are affordable and clean energy sources \\\\\\\\[6\\\\\\\\]. Therefore, the positive attitude of consumers towards adopting renewable energy technology could effectively mitigate energy poverty \\\\\\\\[7\\\\\\\\]. Batool et al. (2022) analyzed that worldwide government prioritize renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty; however, its production and consumption progress is still deficient. Another study evaluated that a successful transition from conventional energy sources to renewable energy sources for alleviating energy poverty depends on the involvement of all stakeholders at multiple levels \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. Energy technology companies are crucial in facilitating the transition towards sustainable energy systems. The deployment of such technologies is highly dependent on collaboration and coordination among various entities such as organizations, stakeholders, and individuals. These actors support energy technology companies by offering expertise, resources, and access to networks vital for successful commercialization \\\\\\\\[9,10\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the contribution of consumers\\' role towards hastening and facilitating this transformation cannot be neglected. As end-users, consumers possess the ultimate decision-making power in choosing between conventional and renewable energy solutions \\\\\\\\[3\\\\\\\\]. The role of consumers in achieving environmental sustainability is crucial, as their consumption and production choices can serve as indicators of achieving zero energy poverty \\\\\\\\[11\\\\\\\\]. India is the second largest populated country, with 1.4 billion people \\\\\\\\[12\\\\\\\\]; energy is needed to support such a significant population and meet industrial needs \\\\\\\\[13\\\\\\\\]. Despite the considerable potential of renewable energy technology for electricity generation, the country still faces severe energy poverty \\\\\\\\[11\\\\\\\\]. India is categorized as a developing country and heavily depends on traditional energy sources, with 69\\xa0% of the population utilizing thermal electricity \\\\\\\\[14\\\\\\\\]. The country is investigating alternative energy sources to decrease its dependence on conventional energy and solve a deficit in energy supply and demand \\\\\\\\[15\\\\\\\\]. The Indian government has implemented many policies promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources \\\\\\\\[16\\\\\\\\]. RETs are the most rapidly expanding energy solution to mitigate worldwide energy crises \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. However, the inadequate provision of electricity has had a significant impact on both the economic growth and the standard of living of the population in India \\\\\\\\[17\\\\\\\\]. In addition, residential and commercial consumers utilize generators, uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), or rechargeable devices to fulfill their energy requirements during power outages, negatively impacting the country\\'s economy. The lack of electricity from the conventional power grid has compelled residential and commercial consumers to adopt renewable energy alternatives for their respective households and workplaces \\\\\\\\[9\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nIndia possesses abundant renewable energy potential, and their utilization can alleviate energy poverty. Despite having significant potential for energy production, the willingness to adopt RETs is at the initial stage in the country \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. Many factors, such as the high initial cost, the inadequate policy framework, the complexity of the technology, and the lack of public knowledge, contribute to the low acceptance rate of RETs \\\\\\\\[3,9,16,18\\\\\\\\]. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on identifying the potential and accessibility of various renewable energy sources in India \\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\[19\\\\\\\\], \\\\\\\\[20\\\\\\\\], \\\\\\\\[21\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\]. Another study evaluated RETs\\' impact on economic growth \\\\\\\\[22,23\\\\\\\\]. Pathak et al. (2022) assessed and prioritized the barriers that impede the development of renewable energy technologies and provided solutions to overcome these barriers in India \\\\\\\\[16\\\\\\\\]. Another prior studies investigated the fact that renewable energy technologies (RETs) are a viable alternative to mitigating carbon emissions in a given country \\\\\\\\[24,25\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nFirst, this current research significantly contributes to the extant literature focusing on the transition from conventional to renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty. Second, India has the renewable energy potential. The current research explores the factors affecting the consumer willingness to adopt the RETs; no prior studies have been done in the Indian context. Third, this study used the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and added a novel factor to understand the consumer willingness to adopt the RETs. Because producing renewable energy technology is not a sign of alleviating energy poverty, it is necessary to consume affordable energy sources to maintain sustainable energy. Therefore, measuring the factors influencing the consumers\\' willingness to adopt the RETs to alleviate energy poverty is essential. This research added a novel element (crime concern) with the existing factors (belief about renewable technology benefits expectation, renewable energy technology cost, environmental concern, subjective norms) to assess the consumer willingness to adopt RETs in the Indian context. Crime is a big issue that impedes consumers\\' willingness to uptake renewable energy. This research will be innovative because no researcher focuses on this main factor. It is the primary research that is contributing novel work to fill the research gap. Furthermore, this research will provide a new dimension to environmentalists, stakeholders, and policymakers to alleviate energy poverty by evaluating consumer behaviors, because studying energy poverty and its link with renewable energy is not enough.\\\\n\\\\nSection 2 presents the theoretical framework, and section 3 develops the hypothesis based on an extensive literature review. Section 4 consists of the research methodology, which defines the data collection technique and tools for data analysis. Section 5 consisted of the empirical results based on measurement and structural models. Section 6 presented discussions and implications regarding the relevant suggestions to motivate the positive influencing factors and demotivate the negative influencing factors to enhance the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technology in the context of energy poverty alleviation. Finally, the 7 section presents the conclusion and policy recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nSection snippets\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nTheoretical framework\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technology, many theoretical models have been used in previous studies, such as the theory of reason action model that was introduced by Martin Fishbein in 1967 \\\\\\\\[26\\\\\\\\], the theory of self-efficacy developed by Albert Bandura in 1977 \\\\\\\\[27\\\\\\\\] and theory of planned behavior (TPB) by Icek Ajzen in 1991 \\\\\\\\[28\\\\\\\\]. TPB, on the other hand, is a frequently used model that predicts and evaluates consumer behavior. According to this theory, a person\\'s\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment of research hypotheses\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nBased on the justification of previous literature, we have developed five hypotheses.\\\\n\\\\nProcess of data collection\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe survey questionnaire used various questions to measure the factors affecting consumer willingness to adopt renewable energy technology. The data was collected from October 2022 to January 2023 in five major cities of India (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad, Ahmedabad). A five-point Likert scale data was used to evaluate the constructs items. Data was collected from 620 dwellers by using convenient random sampling techniques.

In this study, a comprehensive analysis of 13 policy components across three categories of environmental policies, namely, market-based policies, non-market-based policies, and technology support policies, in 19 representative OECD countries from 2004 to 2020, was conducted. Random Forest models were employed to explore the relationships between these policy components and the share of energy from renewable sources. The study successfully identifies the nonlinear relationships, and highlights the varying impact of environmental policy components at different levels. Results indicate that the carbon dioxide tax, expenditure on low-carbon research and development, and the particulate matter emission limit are the most influential components in the model. Analysis of interaction effects across policy categories showed that the combination of the carbon dioxide tax and solar energy support yields the most remarkable synergistic effects on increasing the share of energy from renewable sources. Conversely, the coupling of the carbon dioxide tax with the particulate matter emission limit exhibits strong antagonistic effects. These findings advance knowledge by quantifying relative policy importance, threshold effects, and interactions, bridging gaps in understanding how distinct policy components drive renewable energy transitions. This study identifies key policy stringency levels for achieving specific renewable energy targets and recommends that policymakers adopt a well-coordinated policy mix, considering the potential synergistic and antagonistic effects, to achieve more effective outcomes and mitigate policy conflicts.\\\\n    \\\\n*   ### [Farmers’ Willingness to Achieve Energy Self-Sufficiency in

While the increases in renewable capacity in Europe, the United States and Brazil hit all-time highs, China’s acceleration was extraordinary. In 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, while its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Globally, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide.\\\\n\\\\n#### Achieving the COP28 target of tripling global renewable capacity by 2030 hinges on policy implementation\\\\n\\\\n**Prior to the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai, the International Energy Agency (IEA) urged governments to support five pillars for action by 2030, among them the goal of tripling global renewable power capacity.**Several of the IEA priorities were reflected in the Global Stocktake text agreed by the 198 governments at COP28, including the goals of tripling renewables and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030. Tripling global renewable capacity in the power sector from 2022 levels by 2030 would take it above 11 000 GW, in line with IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.\\\\n\\\\n**Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7 300 GW by 2028. This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030, falling short of the tripling goal.**Governments can close the gap to reach over 11 000 GW by 2030 by overcoming current challenges and implementing existing policies more quickly. These challenges fall into four main categories and differ by country: 1)policy uncertainties and delayed policy responses to the new macroeconomic environment; 2)insufficient investment in grid infrastructure preventing faster expansion of renewables; 3)cumbersome administrative barriers and permitting procedures and social acceptance issues; 4)insufficient financing in emerging and developing economies. This report’s accelerated case shows that addressing those challenges can lead to almost 21% higher growth of renewables, pushing the world towards being on track to meet the global tripling pledge.\\\\n\\\\n### Cumulative renewable electricity capacity in the main and accelerated cases and Net Zero Scenario\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/cumulative-renewable-electricity-capacity-in-the-main-and-accelerated-cases-and-net-zero-scenario)\\\\n\\\\n**What is needed to reach the collective target to triple renewables by 2030 varies significantly by country and region. G20 countries account for almost 90% of global renewable power capacity today.**In the accelerated case, which assumes enhanced implementation of existing policies and targets, the G20 could triple their collective installed capacity by 2030. As such, they have the potential to contribute significantly to tripling renewables globally. However, to achieve the global goal, the rate of new installations needs to accelerate in other countries, too, including many emerging and developing economies outside the G20, some of which do not have renewable targets and/or supportive policies today.\\\\n\\\\n#### The global power mix will be transformed by 2028\\\\n\\\\n**The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the next five years than has been installed since the first commercial renewable energy power plant was built more than 100 years ago.**In the main case forecast in this report, almost 3 700 GW of new renewable capacity comes online over the 2023‑2028 period, driven by supportive policies in more than 130 countries. Solar PV and wind will account for 95% of global renewable expansion, benefiting from lower generation costs than both fossil and non‑fossil fuel alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nOver the coming five years, several renewable energy milestones are expected to be achieved:\\\\n\\\\n*   In 2024, wind and solar PV together generate more electricity than hydropower.\\\\n*   In 2025, renewables surpass coal to become the largest source of electricity generation.\\\\n*   Wind and solar PV each surpass nuclear electricity generation in 2025 and 2026 respectively.\\\\n*   In 2028, renewable energy sources account for over 42% of global electricity generation, with the share of wind and solar PV doubling to 25%.\\\\n\\\\n### Share of renewable electricity generation by technology, 2000-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/share-of-renewable-electricity-generation-by-technology-2000-2028)\\\\n\\\\n#### China is the world’s renewables powerhouse\\\\n\\\\n**China accounts for almost 60% of new renewable capacity expected to become operational globally by 2028.** Despite the phasing out of national subsidies in 2020 and 2021, deployment of onshore wind and solar PV in China is accelerating, driven by the technologies’ economic attractiveness as well as supportive policy environments providing long-term contracts. Our forecast shows that China is expected to reach its national 2030 target for wind and solar PV installations this year, six years ahead of schedule. China’s role is critical in reaching the global goal of tripling renewables because the country is expected to install more than half of the new capacity required globally by 2030. At the end of the forecast period, almost half of China’s electricity generation will come from renewable energy sources.\\\\n\\\\n### Renewable electricity capacity growth in China, main case, 2005-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/renewable-electricity-capacity-growth-in-china-main-case-2005-2028)\\\\n\\\\n### Renewable electricity capacity growth by country or region, main case, 2005-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/renewable-electricity-capacity-growth-by-country-or-region-main-case-2005-2028)\\\\n\\\\n#### The US, the EU, India and Brazil remain bright spots for onshore wind and solar PV growth\\\\n\\\\n**Solar PV and onshore wind additions through 2028 is expected to more than double in the United States, the European Union, India and Brazil compared with the last five years.** Supportive policy environments and the improving economic attractiveness of solar PV and onshore wind are the primary drivers behind this acceleration. In the European Union and Brazil, growth in rooftop solar PV is expected to outpace large-scale plants as residential and commercial consumers seek to reduce their electricity bills amid higher prices. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has acted as a catalyst for accelerated additions despite supply chain issues and trade concerns in the near term. In India, an expedited auction schedule for utility-scale onshore wind and solar PV along with improved financial health of distribution companies is expected to deliver accelerated growth.\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy expansion also starts accelerating in other regions of the world, notably the Middle East and North Africa, owing mostly to policy incentives that take advantage of the cost-competitiveness of solar PV and onshore wind power. Although renewable capacity growth picks up in sub‑Saharan Africa, the region still underperforms considering its resource potential and electrification needs.\\\\n\\\\n#### Solar PV prices plummet amid growing supply glut\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, spot prices for solar PV modules declined by almost 50% year-on-year, with manufacturing capacity reaching three times 2021 levels.** The current manufacturing capacity under construction indicates that the global supply of solar PV will reach 1 100 GW at the end of 2024, with potential output expected to be three times the current forecast for demand. Despite unprecedented PV manufacturing expansion in the United States and India driven by policy support, China is expected to maintain its 80‑95% share of global supply chains (depending on the manufacturing segment). Although developing domestic PV manufacturing will increase the security of supply and bring economic benefits to local communities, replacing imports with more expensive production in the United States, India and the European Union will increase the cost of overall PV deployment in these markets.\\\\n\\\\n#### Onshore wind and solar PV are cheaper than both new and existing fossil fuel plants\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, an estimated 96% of newly installed, utility-scale solar PV and onshore wind capacity had lower generation costs than new coal and natural gas plants.** In addition, three-quarters of new wind and solar PV plants offered cheaper power than existing fossil fuel facilities. Wind and solar PV systems will become more cost-competitive during the forecast period. Despite the increasing contribution needs for flexibility and reliability to integrate variable renewables, the overall competitiveness of onshore wind and solar PV changes only slightly by 2028 in Europe, China, India and the United States.\\\\n\\\\n#### The new macroeconomic environment presents further challenges that policy makers need to address\\\\n\\\\n**In 2023, new renewable energy capacity financed in advanced economies was exposed to higher base interest rates than in China and the global average for the first time.**Since 2022, central bank base interest rates have increased from below 1% to almost 5%. In emerging and developing economies, renewables developers have been exposed to higher interest rates since 2021, resulting in higher costs hampering faster expansion of renewables.\\\\n\\\\n**The implications of this new macroeconomic environment are manifold for both governments and industry.** First, inflation has increased equipment costs for onshore and offshore wind and partly for solar PV (excluding module costs). Second, higher interest rates are increasing the financing costs of capital-intensive variable renewable technologies. Third, policy has been relatively slow to adjust to the new macroeconomic environment due in part to expectations that cost reductions would continue together with permitting challenges. This has left several auctions in advanced economies undersubscribed, particularly in Europe. Additionally, some developers whose power purchase contracts were signed prior to these macroeconomic changes have had to cancel their projects. Efforts to improve auction design and contract indexation methodologies are needed to resolve these challenges and unlock additional wind and solar PV deployment.\\\\n\\\\n**The renewable energy industry, particularly wind, is grappling with macroeconomic challenges affecting its financial health – despite a history of financial resilience.**The wind industry has experienced a significant decline in market value as European and North American wind turbine manufacturers have seen negative net margins for seven consecutive quarters due to volatile demand, limited raw material access, economic challenges, and rising interest rates. To address these issues, the European Union launched a Wind Power Action Plan in October 2023, aiming to enhance competitiveness, improve auction design, boost clean technology investment, streamline permitting, and ensure fair competition. Chinese wind turbine manufacturers, benefiting from strong domestic demand and vertical integration, remain relatively stable amid global challenges.\\\\n\\\\n### Weighted average net margins of renewable energy companies, large utilities and oil majors, Q1-Q4 2022 and Q1-Q3 2023\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/weighted-average-net-margins-of-renewable-energy-companies-large-utilities-and-oil-majors-q1-q4-2022-and-q1-q3-2023)\\\\n\\\\n#### The forecast for wind capacity additions is less optimistic outside China, especially for offshore\\\\n\\\\n**The wind industry, especially in Europe and North America is facing challenges due to a combination of ongoing supply chain disruptions, higher costs and long permitting timelines.** As a result of these challenges, the forecast for onshore wind outside of China has been revised downwards as overall project development has been slower than expected.\\\\n\\\\n**Offshore wind has been hit hardest by the new macroeconomic environment, with its expansion through 2028 revised down by 15% outside China.**The challenges facing the industry particularly affect offshore wind, with investment costs today more than 20% higher than only a few years ago. In 2023, developers have cancelled or postponed 15 GW of offshore wind projects in the United States and the United Kingdom. For some developers, pricing for previously awarded capacity does not reflect the increased costs facing project development today, which reduces project bankability.\\\\n\\\\n#### Faster deployment of variable renewables increases integration and infrastructure challenges\\\\n\\\\n**The share of solar PV and wind in global electricity generation is forecast to double to 25% in 2028 in our main case.**This rapid expansion in the next five years will have implications for power systems worldwide. In the European Union, annual variable renewables penetration in 2028 is expected to reach more than 50% in seven countries, with Denmark having around 90% of wind and solar PV in its electricity system by that time. Although European Union interconnections help integrate solar PV and wind generation, grid bottlenecks will pose significant challenges and lead to increased curtailment in many countries as grid expansion cannot keep pace with accelerated installation of variable renewables.\\\\n\\\\n#### Current hydrogen plans and implementation don’t match\\\\n\\\\n**Renewable power capacity dedicated to hydrogen-based fuel production is forecast to grow by 45 GW between 2023 and 2028, representing only an estimated 7% of announced project capacity for the period.** China, Saudi Arabia and the United States account for more than 75% of renewable capacity for hydrogen production by 2028. Despite announcements of new projects and pipelines, the progress in planned projects has been slow. We have revised down our forecasts for all regions except China. The main reason is the slow pace of bringing planned projects to final investment decisions due to a lack of off‑takers and the impact of higher prices on production costs. The development of an international hydrogen market is a key uncertainty affecting the forecast, particularly for markets that have limited domestic demand for hydrogen.\\\\n\\\\n#### Biofuel deployment is accelerating and diversifying more into renewable diesel and biojet fuel\\\\n\\\\n**Emerging economies, led by Brazil, dominate global biofuel expansion, which is set to grow 30% faster than over the last five years.** Supported by robust biofuel policies, increasing transport fuel demand and abundant feedstock potential, emerging economies are forecast to drive 70% of global biofuel demand growth over the forecast period. Brazil alone accounts for 40% of biofuel expansion to 2028. Stronger policies are the primary driver of this growth as governments expand efforts to provide affordable, secure and low-emission energy supplies. Biofuels used in the road transport sector remain the primary source of new supply, accounting for nearly 90% of the expansion.\\\\n\\\\n### Five-year biofuel demand growth for advanced and emerging economies, main case, 2011-2028\\\\n\\\\n[Open](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/five-year-biofuel-demand-growth-for-advanced-and-emerging-economies-main-case-2011-2028)\\\\n\\\\n**Electric vehicles (EVs) and biofuels are proving to be a powerful complementary combination for reducing oil demand**. Globally, biofuels and renewable electricity used in EVs are forecast to offset 4 million barrels of oil‑equivalent per day by 2028, which is more than 7% of forecast oil demand for transport. Biofuels remain the dominant pathway for avoiding oil demand in the diesel and jet fuel segments. EVs outpace biofuels in the gasoline segment, especially in the United States, Europe and China.\\\\n\\\\n#### Aligning biofuels with a net zero pathway requires a huge increase in the pace of deployment\\\\n\\\\n**This report’s main case forecast is not in line with the near tripling of biofuels demand by 2030 seen in the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.**In the aviation sector for instance, the Net Zero Scenario would require 8% of fuel supply coming from biojet fuel by 2030, while existing policies in this forecast will only bring biojet fuel’s share to 1% by 2028. Bridging this gap requires new and stronger policies, as well as diversification of feedstocks.\\\\n\\\\n**Much faster biofuel deployment is possible through new policies and addressing supply chain challenges.** In this report’s accelerated case, biofuel supply growth is nearly triple that of the main case, closing the gap with the Net Zero Scenario by nearly 40%. Nearly half of this additional growth, almost 30 billion litres, is driven by strengthened policies in existing markets such as the United States, Europe and India. Another 20 billion litres comes mainly from biodiesel in India and ethanol in Indonesia. Biojet fuel offers a third growth avenue, expanding to cover nearly 3.5% of global aviation fuels, up from 1% in the main case. Fuels made from waste and residues also grow four times faster in the accelerated case.\\\\n\\\\n#### Renewable heat accelerates amid high energy prices and policy momentum – but not enough to curb emissions\\\\n\\\\n**Modern renewable heat consumption expands by 40% globally during the outlook period, rising from 13% to 17% of total heat consumption.**These developments come predominantly from the growing reliance on electricity for process heat – notably with the adoption of heat pumps in non‑energy‑intensive industries – and the deployment of electric heat pumps and boilers in buildings, increasingly powered by renewable electricity. China, the European Union and the United States lead these trends, owing to supportive policy environments; updated targets in the European Union and China; strong financial incentives in many markets; the adoption of renewable heat obligations; and fossil fuel bans in the buildings sector.\\\\n\\\\n**However, the trends to 2028 are still largely insufficient to tackle the use of fossil fuels for heat and put the world on track to meet Paris Agreement goals.** Without stronger policy action, the global heat sector alone between 2023 and 2028 could consume more than one‑fifth of the remaining carbon budget for a pathway aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Global renewable heat consumption would have to rise 2.2 times as quickly and be combined with wide-scale demand-side measures and much larger energy and material efficiency improvements to align with the NZE Scenario.\\\\n\\\\nNext[Electricity](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/electricity#abstract)\\\\n\\\\n### Newsletters\\\\n\\\\nThe best of IEA sent straight to your inbox\\\\n\\\\n[Subscribe to newsletters](https://www.iea.org/newsletter)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 25](https://www.iea.org/assets/front/images/footer/footer-newsletters.png?w=260&h=196&fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format)\\\\n\\\\n### Podcasts\\\\n\\\\nTop energy experts put IEA analysis in context\\\\n\\\\n[Listen to our podcast](https://www.iea.org/podcasts)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 26](https://www.iea.org/assets/front/images/footer/footer-podcast.png?w=260&h=213&fit=crop&fm=jpg&q=70&auto=format)\\\\n\\\\n*   Understand energy\\\\n*   [Reports](https://www.iea.org/analysis?type=report)\\\\n*   [News and commentaries](https://www.iea.org/news)\\\\n*   [Events](https://www.iea.org/events)\\\\n*   [Energy system](https://www.iea.org/energy-system)\\\\n*   [Topics](https://www.iea.org/topics)\\\\n*   [Countries and regions](https://www.iea.org/countries)\\\\n*   [Glossary](https://www.iea.org/glossary)\\\\n\\\\n*   Explore data\\\\n*   [Data explorers](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-explorers)\\\\n*   [Data sets](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-sets)\\\\n*   [Policies database](https://www.iea.org/policies)\\\\n*   [Chart library](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts)\\\\n*   [Energy Statistics Browser](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics#browser)\\\\n\\\\n*   IEA essentials\\\\n*   [About](https://www.iea.org/about)\\\\n*   [Mission](https://www.iea.org/about/mission)\\\\n*   [Membership](https://www.iea.org/about/membership)\\\\n*   [Structure](https://www.iea.org/about/structure)\\\\n*   [Programmes](https://www.iea.org/programmes)\\\\n*   [International collaborations](https://www.iea.org/about/international-collaborations)\\\\n*   [Technology collaboration](https://www.iea.org/about/technology-collaboration)\\\\n*   [Training](https://www.iea.org/about/training)\\\\n\\\\n*   Connect\\\\n*   [Contact](https://www.iea.org/contact)\\\\n*   [Press](https://www.iea.org/help-centre/press-and-promotions)\\\\n*   [Jobs](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/OECD/iea)\\\\n*   [Internships](https://www.iea.org/about/internships)\\\\n*   [Delegates](https://ieaorg.sharepoint.com/sites/delegates)\\\\n*   [Help centre](https://www.iea.org/help-centre)\\\\n\\\\n[](https://www.iea.org/)\\\\n\\\\n©2025 IEA\\\\n*   [Terms](https://www.iea.org/terms)\\\\n*   [Privacy](https://www.iea.org/privacy)\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/user/IEAEnergy)\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-energy-agency/)\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/profile/iea.org)\\\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/internationalenergyagency/)\\\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/internationalenergyagency/?hl=en)\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/iea)\\\\n\\\\n[](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/executive-summary#header)\\\\n\\\\n#### Subscription successful\\\\n\\\\nThank you for subscribing.

Solar and wind power are key beneficiaries, with tax credits and grants incentivizing rapid adoption. Globally, investments in low-carbon energy hit **$1.1 trillion in 2022**, according to [BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/energy-transition-investment/), while the U.S. clean energy sector is projected to create **millions of jobs** by 2030.\\\\n\\\\nYet challenges persist. In February 2023, **60% of U.S. electricity** still came from fossil fuels, versus **21.5% from renewables**—a disconnect between policy goals and real-world implementation.\\\\n\\\\n**How do Americans view this transition?**  \\\\nWe surveyed **400+ U.S. adults** to explore:\\\\n\\\\nThe results offer actionable insights for businesses and policymakers navigating this critical decade for climate action.\\\\n\\\\n## Outlook Toward Renewable Energy in the US\\\\n\\\\nSolar energy is the most recognized renewable source among Americans (73%), followed by wind (48%) and hydropower (30%). However, **the U.S. is the world’s second-largest renewable energy producer, trailing only China**. Actual usage tells a different story: solar accounts for just 16% of U.S. renewable electricity generation, while wind (48%) and hydropower (29%) dominate. **Wind power alone generated 10% of the nation’s total electricity in 2022**, underscoring its outsized role. Together, renewables supplied **21.5% of total U.S. electricity** in early 2023, per the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3).\\\\n\\\\n![Familiarity with Renewable Energy Sources in the US](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image6-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nThe majority of Americans also showed a positive perception of renewable energy in the US. The data reflecting a combined percentage of 64.1% for ‘positive’ and ‘very positive’ responses indicates a prevailing shift in attitudes towards renewable energy in the US.\\\\n\\\\nThis shift can be attributed to various factors, including heightened awareness of climate change, increased education about the benefits of renewable energy, and the growing emphasis on sustainable living.\\\\n\\\\nA 2022 [study](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-age-race-ethnicity-gender/) by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication revealed that younger Americans are becoming more concerned about global warming than they were a decade ago.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Americans Want to Switch to Renewable Energy\\\\n\\\\n### **Current Adoption Trends**\\\\n\\\\nToday, **30% of Americans** use renewable energy at home or work—but nearly the same percentage (30%) are unsure whether their energy sources are clean.\\\\n\\\\nAmong adopters, **70% rely on solar power**, primarily through rooftop panels, highlighting its visibility in residential markets. By contrast, solar accounts for just **16% of utility-scale renewable electricity**, reflecting slower institutional adoption.\\\\n\\\\n![Most Utilized Renewable Energy Sources in the US](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image5-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### **Sentiment Toward Transition**\\\\n\\\\nPublic enthusiasm is rising: **32.5% of Americans** are open to adopting renewables, while only **7% oppose the idea entirely**. Advocacy is even stronger: **66.5%** would recommend renewables to others, with **36%** being passionate advocates. Resistance is minimal, with less than **10%** expressing reluctance.\\\\n\\\\n**Key Drivers of Adoption**  \\\\nThree factors dominate decision-making:\\\\n\\\\nThis disconnect—**strong public support but lagging infrastructure**—suggests a cultural shift outpacing systemic change.\\\\n\\\\n![image7 1](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image7-1.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### Challenges Hindering the Adoption\\\\n\\\\n**1. Cost Barriers**  \\\\n**44% of Americans** cite affordability as the top hurdle. For example, residential solar panel installations cost **$4,500–$36,000** (averaging $16,000), with pricing shaped by home size, location, and equipment efficiency (Forbes).\\\\n\\\\n**2. Awareness Gaps**  \\\\n**1 in 4 respondents** lacks basic knowledge about renewable options, while **11%** fear technical hurdles like installation complexity or grid integration issues (e.g., inconsistent energy storage).\\\\n\\\\n**3. Systemic Inertia**  \\\\nWhile households embrace rooftop solar, utility-scale adoption lags. Bridging this gap requires simpler processes, public-private partnerships, and consumer education campaigns.\\\\n\\\\n![Biggest Challenges Facing Americans in the Adoption of Renewable Energy](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image8-1080x609.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n## To Wrap Up\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. energy landscape is changing rapidly. Federal investments like the Inflation Reduction Act—which dedicates $370 billion to clean energy—are accelerating this shift. But while policymakers debate solutions, **Americans are already forming strong opinions**: 64% view renewable energy positively, and over a third would actively recommend it to others.\\\\n\\\\nThe stakes for businesses are clear. **Our survey highlights three priorities for consumers**:\\\\n\\\\nYounger generations are driving demand, with 36% “very likely” to advocate for renewables. For companies, this isn’t just about ethics—it’s economics. Brands that cut costs, demystify green tech, and highlight environmental benefits **will win trust** in a crowded market.\\\\n\\\\nYes, fossil fuels still dominate 60% of U.S. electricity generation. But public sentiment is shifting faster than infrastructure. Businesses that act on these insights now won’t just follow trends—they’ll set them.\\\\n\\\\n## Elevate Your Consumer Research\\\\n\\\\n## Sign Up For More Like This.\\\\n\\\\nGet our latest articles on consumer insights and marketing strategy, with actionable ideas designed to inspire your next bold move.\\\\n\\\\n## You might also like...\\\\n\\\\n![a woman wearing a feathered garment for Brazil Carnival](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Celebrations-in-Brazil-1080x609.png)\\\\n\\\\n### [The Best Celebrations in Brazil According to Its People](https://standard-insights.com/insights/best-celebrations-in-brazil/)\\\\n\\\\n![AI at Work: Southeast Asia\\'s Perspective](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0-1080x609.png)\\\\n\\\\n### [AI at Work: Southeast Asia’s Perspective](https://standard-insights.com/insights/workplace-automation-southeast-asia/)\\\\n\\\\n![a woman wearing a head scarf looking at a laptop](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Future-Of-Work-Malaysia-1080x609.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### [The Future of Work in Malaysia](https://standard-insights.com/insights/the-future-of-work-in-malaysia/)\\\\n\\\\n## Start your next consumer research\\\\n\\\\nCreate your free account, and use our set of tools to conduct your research easily.\\\\n\\\\n![Standard Insights logo](https://standard-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Light-Green-250x55-1.webp)\\\\n\\\\nWe’re dusting off the Market Research industry.\"}, {\"title\": \"Understanding domestic consumer attitude and behaviour towards energy ...\", \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421523002781\", \"content\": \"For domestic heating, heat pumps (Gong et al., 2023), solar thermal panels (\\\\\"Generating renewable electricity, 2023) and energy efficient boilers (Kerr and Winskel, 2022) are observed as key systems for decarbonisation and for domestic energy management, the following tend to be instrumental in harnessing domestic energy demand and home\", \"score\": 0.67988104}, {\"title\": \"PDF\", \"url\": \"https://www.global-climatescope.org/downloads/climatescope-2023-report-en.pdf\", \"content\": \"surveyed with tax incentives in force Tax incentives serve as foundation to renewables deployment Source: BloombergNEF.

This is the third year the project has covered not only the power sector but transportation and buildings as well.\\\\nClimatescope represents the collective efforts of over 50 BNEF analysts. Each year, these researchers gather detailed data on 140 markets across the globe, including 110 emerging economies and 30 developed ones. This year, Montenegro, Bahrain, Iceland and Venezuela were added to the list. The resulting report assesses macro-level energy transition trends and scores individual markets based on their attractiveness for receiving clean energy capital. Other conclusions from the 2023 edition of Climatescope include: Zero-carbon electricity technologies – including wind, solar, hydropower and nuclear – have now reached 46% of global installed power capacity, up from 33% in 2012. • Meanwhile, fossil fuels’ share of new build capacity slumped to the lowest level ever in 2022, at just 13%, compared to 50% in 2013. Even a resurgence in coal power additions couldn’t halt the slide.\\\\nExecutive summary 75% Share of emerging markets’ power capacity additions that came from solar in 2022 $560 billion Global funding for renewable energy projects in 2022, a record high 93% Share of surveyed emerging markets that have renewable energy targets in force Source: BloombergNEF Share of global power capacity additions, by technology 32% 30% 28% 33% 23% 27% 22% 27% 21% 14% 10% 16% 4% 7% 24% 26% 29% 15% 22% 20% 23% 17% 14% 19% 23% 10% 10% 14% 5% 16% 13% 12% 14% 15% 18% 14% 10% 12% 5% 6% 4% 7% 7% 5% 17% 20% 15% 18% 20% 13% 19% 22% 18% 20% 17% 22% 31% 27% 21% 4% 4% 7% 13% 14% 16% 18% 19% 26% 39% 36% 42% 45% 49% 59% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Coal Natural gas Hydro Wind Solar Nuclear Oil and diesel Biomass and waste Other - fossil 4 November 29, 2023 • Global investment in renewable energy projects hit a record $560 billion in 2022, with small-scale photovoltaic solar accounting for over a fifth of the total. Successful net-metering policies and tax incentives have fueled the sector’s meteoric rise, which attracted twice as much investment in 2022 as two years prior. • Utility-scale solar also had a banner year, accounting for 41% of renewable energy investment last year, beating out wind, which received 36% of the total.\\\\nEmerging markets are becoming increasingly important players in the clean-power space. Of the 341 gigawatts of new wind and solar additions in 2022, some 222 gigawatts were added in developing economies.\\\\n• In most emerging markets, levelized costs of electricity for solar and wind – the long-term offtake price that a power plant needs to break even – have fallen dramatically. That means new solar and wind projects can now build more capacity with less investment. • Out of the 110 emerging markets surveyed in this report, a record 74 had at least 1 megawatt of solar capacity installed last year, compared to just 30 markets a decade ago. • In line with broader global trends, fossil-fuel additions in emerging markets fell to a record low in 2022. • Yet, investment remains concentrated in a handful of emerging economies. Just 15 markets attracted 86% of the $81 billion in clean-energy investments that were directed toward emerging economies (excluding mainland China) last year. Brazil alone received $25 billion, followed by $12 billion for India and $6 billion for South Africa. The list of the top developing-market recipients of clean-energy investment remains essentially unchanged over the past five years. Of the emerging markets surveyed by Climatescope, 93% have renewable energy targets in force. But most still face an uphill battle to achieve these targets. • Around 60% of emerging markets with a clean energy target have yet to meet even the half-way mark of their ambitions, even though most of these goals are due in 2030.\\\\nExecutive summary (2) 5 November 29, 2023 • While these markets have improved their policy books over the years, more – and more effective – policies must still be adopted. Net metering, which is now present in 59% of the emerging markets surveyed, is the policy type that has seen the greatest growth since 2021.\\\\n• Policy is now particularly relevant as world leaders have expressed interest in tripling global installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. According to BNEF’s report Tripling Global Renewables by 2030 (web | terminal), scaling up the right mix of technologies will require measures that address barriers to access, enable competitive auctions and encourage corporate power purchase agreements. India has been among the top five most attractive emerging markets for renewable energy investment since 2018, and this year it returned to the highest position in Climatescope’s ranking of developing economies. Its ambitious policy framework and extremely competitive renewable energy market have attracted around $47 billion of clean energy investment over the past five years. • Mainland China, which continues to play a key role in the global clean energy story, ranked second this year among emerging markets, having accounted for 52% of global investment in 2022. It presents a wealth of opportunities for the global energy transition, since it is estimated that by 2030, some 35% of the world’s installed solar capacity and 50% of wind will be located in the giant Asian market. Chile, which last year stood atop the podium, comes in third, with its well-established clean energy policies, bold targets and overall commitment to greening its grid keeping it in the top three.\\\\n• Fourth place goes to the Philippines, which appears in the top-five list for the first time thanks to its auctions, feed-in tariffs, net-metering schemes, tax incentives and strong targets for renewable energy. Brazil, where the small-scale segment is the main driver of clean energy deployment, comes in fifth.\\\\nGlobal passenger electric vehicle sales hit 10.3 million units in 2022, nearly doubling from 2021. In just six years, the share of EVs in total passenger vehicle sales has jumped more than 10-fold, from 1.4% in 2017 to 15% in 2022. • The 6.1 million EVs sold in mainland China accounted for 60% of the global total in 2022 and nearly 96% of sales in emerging markets. Its cumulative EV sales since 2017 now stand at 13 million, some 4.5 million more than the top 10 developed markets for EVs combined.\\\\nExecutive summary (3) 6 November 29, 2023 • Other emerging markets represent a tiny share of total global EV sales, but their progress should not be overlooked. In 2021, these markets accounted for just 3% of global EV sales, but the number of units sold has nearly doubled for each of the past two years. Electrified heating has gained considerable popularity over the past decade, although sales of heat pumps stalled in 2022, rising only 1% year-on-year, compared to a 7% average compound annual growth rate over the past decade. • Heat pump demand remains dependent on subsidies or other consumer support mechanisms due to high upfront costs, and in many markets the technology struggles to compete with gas-fired boilers. • Government bans on the purchase of certain types of boilers have increased in recent years. Of the 29 markets surveyed by Climatescope, 15 have legislated bans on boilers for one or more technology.

Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Yemen and Libya are not in the coverage due to local conflicts or international sanctions that make them particularly challenging to research.\\\\nAbout Climatescope Climatescope is an online market assessment tool, report and index that evaluates individual markets’ readiness to put energy transition investment to work. A deep dive into how surveyed markets are driving the energy transition, it provides snapshots of current clean energy policy and finance conditions that can lead to future capital deployment and project development.\\\\nThis is the 12th edition of Climatescope, and the project has evolved significantly since its launch more than a decade ago. It now includes detailed information on 140 markets, including 110 emerging economies and 30 developed ones. This year, four new markets have been added to the coverage: Bahrain, Iceland, Montenegro and Venezuela. Climatescope’s sectoral coverage has also expanded over the years. While early editions of the report focused on just the power sector, in 2021 we began including in-depth investment condition data for lower-carbon transportation and buildings.\\\\nThe project now encompasses nearly every market in the world*. Developed markets are defined as OECD countries minus Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Turkey. These five are part of the OECD but remain attractive emerging markets for clean energy development. Developing markets include all non-OECD markets, plus these five. Readers are encouraged to explore the complete rankings, datasets, methodology, tools and market profiles on the Climatescope website. 9 November 29, 2023 Renewables take the lead 03.\\\\nPower sector 10 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF.

Zero-carbon technologies consist of renewable sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and small hydro), large hydro and nuclear.\\\\nShare of global generation by technology With nearly 3,500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power produced in 2022, wind and solar accounted for a combined 12.6% of global generation in 2022. Wind’s contribution rose to 8%, up from just 4% six years ago, while solar reached nearly 5%, from less than 1.5% in 2016. Non-hydro renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass) attained 15% of total generation, nearly doubling their 8% share in 2016.\\\\nZero-carbon technologies accounted for 40% of total generation in 2022. Hydro and nuclear represented 15.4% and 9.5% respectively in 2022, but the relative participation of these technologies in the grid has declined over the past decade due to the growing additions of other zero-carbon technologies such as solar and wind. Although fossil fuels still dominate global electricity generation, their share is slowly decreasing. Coal, natural gas, oil and other fossil fuels generated 65% of the world’s electricity at the beginning of the decade and now represent 59%.

Renewable includes wind, solar, biomass and waste, geothermal and hydro technologies.\\\\nGlobal annual generation by technology Total global power production jumped 3.1% in 2022 in midst of the economic recovery from Covid-19 and the European energy crisis. Generation rose from 26,700TWh in 2021 to 27,500TWh in 2022, marking a new high. Renewables accounted for 75% of the total generation change from 2021 to 2022. Renewables (including large hydro) led the growth in total electricity production, with an 8% jump from 2021 to 2022. Total global renewable generation reached its highest level ever in 2022, at 8,400TWh, and represented over 30% of global generation for the first time. Solar accounted for 1,350TWh, and wind 2,100TWh. Fossil fuels remain the main source of electricity generation, at 16,500TWh, or nearly 60% of total power demand. Coal generation reached a new record, generating 9,600TWh in 2022, up 7% compared with 2020 and 2% from 2021. Natural gas topped 6,200TWh, a rise of 3% from 2021. Meanwhile, oil generation slid 6% in 2022, compared with a 3% increase from 2020 to 2021.\\\\nRenewables led the upsurge in global generation 8.6 8.8 9.1 8.9 8.9 9.0 9.3 9.3 8.9 9.4 9.6 5.0 4.9 5.0 5.3 5.5 5.6 5.8 6.0 5.9 6.0 6.2 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.8 4.0 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.2 4.2 4.2 2.5 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.6 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.8 2.6 1.6 1.9 2.1 1.1 1.4 21.7 22.0 22.7 23.1 23.7 24.2 25.1 25.7 25.6 26.7 27.5 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thousand terawatt-hours Coal Natural gas Hydro Nuclear Wind Solar Biomass and waste Oil and diesel Other - fossil Geothermal Marine 12 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF.

For more, see BNEF’s 1H 2023 LCOE Update.\\\\nGlobal year-on-year change in generation Net renewable energy power generation set a record in 2022, led by a particularly strong showing from solar. Three main factors explain renewables becoming the most pragmatic option: fast-growing post-pandemic electricity demand overall, a jump in coal and natural gas prices, and lower renewable levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs). Although coal generation grew less in 2022 than it did in 2021, it still saw a considerable increase, reaching 209TWh on a year-on-year change basis. This surge is backed by China, India and Europe. Thanks to energy security concerns, coal was brought back into power systems.\\\\nWind and solar generation thrive amid the global energy crisis 385 132 326 -212 140 316 -347 451 209 197 134 115 128 94 50 96 -79 224 -105 95 349 160 76 233 189 -97 157 -230 79 -79 94 -131 118 133 134 163 201 271 92 107 66 120 135 178 126 173 168 265 243 -750 -500 -250 0 250 500 750 1,000 1,250 1,500 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Terawatt-hours Wind Solar Other - fossil Oil and diesel Nuclear Natural Gas Hydro Geothermal Coal Biomass and waste 13 November 29, 2023 Source: BloombergNEF. ‘Other - fossil’ accounts for plants that use more than one fuel or fuels other than coal, oil, gas, hydro and nuclear. Global installed capacity by technology Global installed power-generating capacity reached a new high of 8.3 terawatts (TW) in 2022, representing a year-on-year growth of over 5% from 2021 to 2022. Global installed capacity in 2022 also represented a growth of over 50% from the 5.4TW installed 10 years ago. Wind and solar accounted for over a quarter of global capacity for the first time in 2022. Together, these technologies represented nearly 26% of global capacity as of year-end 2022. Zero-carbon technologies reached 46% of global capacity, up from 33% in 2012. Wind and solar saw the fastest growth of any type of generation. Solar capacity in 2022 jumped 20% from the year prior, to 1,228 gigawatts (GW) – more than 11 times the 101GW that was online in 2012 and 176 times the 6GW that was installed in 2006. Global wind capacity bounced 10% over 2021-2022 to reach 930GW, tripling in a decade. Coal still accounts for the largest individual share of global capacity, with 2.2TW, or 26% of the global power matrix. Online coal capacity continues to rise in absolute numbers even as its share on a percentage basis declines.

Share of global capacity additions by technology New power-generating capacity added globally reached a record 424GW in 2022, with solar and wind accounting for 80% of the total. This was up 14% from 371GW in 2021, and up more than 80% compared with the 231GW added in 2012.\\\\nSolar accounted for 59% of all capacity added, followed by wind, at 21%. Solar photovoltaic (PV) additions in 2022 were nearly 40% higher than in 2021. Wind capacity additions dropped by 10% compared with 2021, held back by challenges around permitting, interconnection, supply chains and profitability. Supply chain bottlenecks have limited late-stage project deployment as well as rising costs for developers.\\\\nRenewables (including hydro) encompassed 86% of total capacity additions in 2022.

Fossil fuels’ net additions in developed economies shrank in 2022, totaling just 6% of new build, compared with 8% in 2021 and 28% in 2017. Natural gas accounted for just 4GW, compared with 21GW in 2018.\\\\nDeveloped markets saw coal retirements slow down in 2022. As Europe struggled with droughts and gas supply cuts from Russia, coal has turned into a short-term crutch to meet energy needs. As result, many economies have delayed coal phase-out plans and even restarted capacity that had been mothballed. Across all technologies, a record near-110GW of renewable capacity was added in developed markets in 2022. Solar leads with 77GW, while wind was the second-most-added technology, at 31GW.

This is the biggest increase in coal net additions since 2019, when it accounted for 60GW. This is mainly attributed to mainland China, which added 33GW of coal capacity in 2022 alone. After a rise in 2021, net additions from natural gas dropped to 19GW in 2022, down from 45GW the year prior. With solar and wind taking the lead, developing markets have added more capacity than ever. These markets saw 13% growth in net additions in one year, to 310GW in 2022. Solar added a record 164GW, 57% more than in 2021.

Note: Data considers only 140 markets covered by Climatescope. Markets with at least 1 megawatt installed per year, 2013-2022 In 2022, at least 101 markets installed at least 1 megawatt (MW) of solar capacity – a new high. This figure is nearly double the 53 markets that did so in 2013. The modular nature of PV, along with steep equipment price declines over the course of the past decade, explain the technology’s proliferation.\\\\nHydro saw 47 markets adding over 1MW in 2022, the highest number in the last three years and four more than in 2021. Wind, on the other hand, dropped to 42 markets adding at least 1MW, compared to 48 in 2021. Coal saw an uptick in markets that installed at least 1MW of this technology in 2022, while oil plummeted to its lowest level since at least 2013 and natural gas kept stable. Despite the drop, oil was the fossil fuel technology installed in the greatest number of markets (38), followed by gas (35) and coal (14).\\\\nSolar is by far the most popular technology added worldwide 53 101 42 35 47 38 14 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Solar Wind Natural gas Hydro Oil and diesel Coal Number of markets 21 November 29, 2023 Solar and wind now have the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of any technology. Solar and wind LCOEs increased slightly in 2021 and 2022, due to a rise in commodity and freight prices and higher interest rates imposed by central banks, yet fossil fuels saw their costs rise even further. Solar modules and wind turbine installations are intensifying as equipment costs fall. This year, solar module prices hit an all-time low, decreasing capital expenditures – or the sum of development, equipment and construction costs – for PV projects. This means that each dollar invested can support more capacity.\\\\nSince 2022, renewables have become cheaper than coal even in Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines. For the first time ever, building an offshore wind project is roughly the same price on average as building a coal-fired power plant – and cheaper than building one fired by gas. Offshore wind and coal now boast an LCOE of $74 per megawatt-hour (MWh), compared with $92/GW for natural gas. In markets representing 60% of global electricity generation, it is now cheaper to build solar and wind power plants than to keep running existing plants fired by gas and coal.\\\\nGlobal wind capacity and investment 2018-2022 Global solar capacity and investment 2018-2022 As capex costs for renewables fall, each dollar invested has a greater impact Source: BloombergNEF.

Clean energy investment almost doubled from 2018 to 2022, with mainland China accounting for the largest share of investment post-2020, with 52% in 2022. Wind and solar reached new highs in 2022, together accounting for 98% of the year’s renewable energy investment. Solar alone represented 63% of the total. Investment in utility-scale solar projects saw a 38% increase from 2021 to 2022, while wind increased 4% over the same period.\\\\nFor the first time since 2018, utility-scale photovoltaic solar (PV) raked in more than wind, with $230 billion – or 41% of global renewable energy investment – in 2022. Wind received nearly 36% of global investment, or $199 billion. Small-scale PV projects came in third, with 21%, while other renewables together accounted for the remaining 2%.\\\\nInvestment in small-scale PV projects soared to a record high in 2022, growing 57% year-on-year and more than tripling compared to 2018. This growth was mainly driven by net-metering and tax incentive policies in key emerging markets.

In 2022, the top 15 emerging markets (excluding mainland China) for new-build clean energy investment attracted $70 billion, or 87% of all investment in emerging markets. The list remains largely unchanged from the top 15 markets for cumulative renewable energy investment over 2017-2021, although in 2022 Uzbekistan, the Philippines, Colombia and Saudi Arabia edged out Ukraine, Argentina, Russia and Morocco. Investment in renewable energy skyrocketed in Brazil in 2022, when the market attracted $25 billion – compared with a cumulative $41 billion over the five preceding years. This jump was mainly thanks to a successful net-metering policy aligned with tax incentives benefitting small-scale PV projects, which attracted $13 billion in 2022, the same amount the technology had received over 2017-2021 combined.

Among the 15 developed and emerging markets that finished at the top of the Climatescope scoring table, the average cumulative investment over the last five years was $24 billion. Meanwhile, the 15 markets that finished at the bottom of the ranking averaged $291 million. Comparing countries’ policy scores with levels of attracted investment reveals the key role policies can play in mobilizing capital. Difficulty in diversifying investment across emerging markets is directly linked to the absence of environments conducive to attracting such investments. Having effective policies and a mature, transparent power market that is open to private players, for example, renders a market more attractive to clean energy investment.\\\\nPolicy plays a major role in clean energy investment and deployment Source: BloombergNEF, Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

Due to an increase in the adoption of these targets, only 7% of the continent’s markets have no clean energy policy in force; one year ago this share was of 12%. Nevertheless, many markets in the region have yet to implement the necessary policies that would propel their power sectors toward a cleaner and more sustainable future. Among regions, Africa has the lowest adoption of other kinds of renewable energy policies, and only 24% of its markets have at least three mechanism in force. In Europe, more than a third of emerging markets have at least four clean power policies in force, the largest share of any region. All markets in the Asia-Pacific region have renewables targets, and 36% have at least three policies in place, while in the Middle East, 60% of markets have three policies on the books. And more than half of the markets in Latin America have two policies, often a renewable energy target and an auction or net-metering policy.\\\\nShare of emerging markets in each region with a specific number of policy mechanisms in force Policy adoption rates vary widely by region Source: BloombergNEF.

Note: Includes 110 emerging markets surveyed through the end of July 2023.\\\\nEmerging markets with auctions, feed-in tariffs or both Reverse auctions for clean power delivery contracts and feed-in tariffs have proved to be two of the more effective policies for spurring renewable energy build. As of 2023, 63 of the 110 emerging markets surveyed in this report have auction mechanisms, while 32 have feed-in tariffs. Twenty markets have both.\\\\nAmong regions, emerging Europe has the highest share – 77% – of developing countries with such policies. In Latin America, auctions are the most popular mechanism for enabling the development of renewables; these are present in more than half of the region’s markets.\\\\nAfrican markets were initially slow to adopt these policies but have recently made significant strides: now, almost half have auctions in place. The adoption of such policies has helped support clean energy investment and capacity deployment across the continent. More than half of emerging markets conduct auctions for renewable energy contracts 27 November 29, 2023 In 2023, 93% of the emerging markets covered by Climatescope have renewable energy targets in place. This represents a leap of 11 percentage points in just two years. Renewable energy targets are by far the most popular type of policy, but most of these markets lack the mechanisms to help deliver them.\\\\nReverse auctions for clean power delivery contracts and net metering to support rooftop solar are also rapidly gaining traction. In 2023, 57% of markets surveyed had auction policies in force, compared to 49% in 2021. Net metering is now present in 59% of emerging markets, compared to 49% in 2021, and the growth of this kind of incentive is helping distributed solar spread to more markets.\\\\nFeed-in tariffs are the only type of policy losing ground. In 2023, they are available in 28% of emerging markets, compared with 30% in 2022. The reasons for renouncing an incentive may vary. While it’s common to move from feed-in tariffs to reverse auctions, retroactive changes may happen due to regulatory issues or governmental changes.\\\\nShare of emerging markets surveyed where key renewable power policies are present, 2021-2023 Clean power policies have made progress in emerging markets – but are still not on track for meeting targets Source: BloombergNEF.

Currently, the majority of emerging markets covered by Climatescope have such targets. The increased rate of these policies’ adoption can be attributed mainly to international commitments and the pressure imposed by events such as the Conference of the Parties (COP).\\\\nHowever, among the markets that have a renewable energy target in force, almost 60% have yet to meet even the half-way mark, even though most of these goals are set to come due in 2030. Governments must thus balance ambition with feasibility when it comes to setting targets. Achieving targets also requires setting effective policies, such as tax incentives, auctions, feed-in tariffs and net metering.\\\\nStrong renewable energy targets signal ambition – but not always effectiveness 29 November 29, 2023 Tax incentives are another important measure adopted mainly in emerging markets. Governments in these markets use tax reductions or exemptions in order to attract project developers and subsidize upfront costs.\\\\nThe most common type of tax incentive in the emerging markets surveyed by Climatescope is an import tax, which is available in 59% of the 110 markets. Value-added tax (VAT) exemptions/reductions, present in 55%, come in a close second. Accelerated depreciation – by which renewable energy asset book values decrease at a faster rate than they would using traditional depreciation methods – is the least common, but still present in 25% of the emerging markets. 2023 share of emerging markets surveyed with tax incentives in force Tax incentives serve as foundation to renewables deployment Source: BloombergNEF.

This marks an all-time high, and a jump of 10 percentage points from the 20% share in 2012. In absolute numbers, G-20 economies saw renewable generation almost double over the last decade, from 3,300TWh in 2012 to 6,500TWh in 2022.\\\\nAmong G-20 economies, only Brazil and Canada have more than 60% of their generation coming from renewable energy sources; in both cases, the high share is thanks to large hydro fleets. The other 17 economies are still lagging when it comes to adding more renewables to the grid and meeting their often-ambitious renewable energy targets.\\\\nSaudi Arabia, South Africa and South Korea are still falling behind most of their peers. Such markets are highly reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generation and have a long way to go to be on track to meet their 2050 net-zero pledges.\\\\nBrazil has one of the world’s cleanest energy matrixes. This is mainly attributable to its natural resources, especially hydro power.

As of year-end 2022, APAC had 4.1TW installed, with mainland China alone accounting for 30% of the global total. Mainland China’s capacity has more than doubled over the decade, from 1.1TW in 2012 to 2.5TW in 2022. All regions broadly held their respective shares from 2021 to 2022. Europe remaining the second largest region for installed capacity with 20% of the global share, followed by North America at 17%. However, these are the only two regions that have seen a sharp drop in their capacity shares since 2006, when each accounted for around 26% of global capacity. This is mainly attributed to the steep increase in mainland China’s installed capacity. Despite being home to around 16% of the world’s population, Africa has just 3% of installed global capacity. This share has remained stable over the past 15 years.\\\\nAPAC is home to half of global installed capacity 16% 17% 18% 19% 20% 21% 22% 23% 24% 25% 26% 27% 27% 28% 29% 30% 27% 27% 26% 26% 26% 25% 25% 24% 23% 22% 22% 21% 21% 20% 20% 20% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 18% 19% 19% 19% 19% 19% 19% 19% 25% 25% 24% 24% 23% 23% 22% 21% 21% 20% 20% 19% 19% 18% 18% 17% 7% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 6% 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% 5% 5% 5% 5% 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Mainland China Europe Asia-Pacific (excl.

The % change in global installed capacity by region refers to the 2012-2022 period.\\\\nGlobal installed capacity by region APAC’s total installed capacity has nearly doubled in a decade. Capacity jumped from 2.1TW in 2012 to 4.1TW in 2022. In absolute terms, mainland China, India and Japan led the region’s growth, accounting for 1,729GW added in the last decade. Ambitious deployment goals and enabling policy frameworks have allowed APAC to consistently expand the deployment of renewables.\\\\nAfrica followed, with a 67% jump over the same period. In 2022, the continent reached 237GW of capacity, up from 121GW in 2012. Egypt, South Africa and Algeria are among the African markets that saw their installed capacity grow most over the period, together adding nearly 57GW in a decade. Europe and North America have grown least since 2012. These regions each saw their power matrix grow by just 20%. However, despite the European energy crisis and the Russia-Ukraine war, Europe saw a slight increase in installed capacity in 2022. In North America, the uptake was mainly led by the US with the establishment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which will kickstart an upsurge of renewables.\\\\nAfrica has seen the fastest capacity growth in the past 10 years +45% +55% +19% +97% +20% +67% 2.1 2.3 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.7 0.5 0.3 0.2 5.4 5.7 5.9 6.2 6.5 6.7 7.0 7.3 7.6 8.0 8.4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Terawatts Africa Middle East Latin America Europe North America and Caribbean Asia-Pacific 38 November 29, 2023 Additions by technology Renewable additions by economy The G-20 represents 86% of global installed capacity additions Source: BloombergNEF.

Wind and solar alone accounted for 74% of additions, while hydro covered just 4%. Biomass and geothermal together summed around 1% of additions in 2022. The G-20 economies account for 85% of the global GDP, over 75% of the global trade and around two-thirds of the world population. However, renewable additions in the G-20 are mostly concentrated in four markets: mainland China, the US, India and Brazil. Together, these economies accounted for 81% of G-20 renewable additions in 2022. These four also saw the biggest growth in renewable capacity additions in 2022, almost tripling such additions compared to 2012 numbers.\\\\nAmong G-20 economies, net coal additions rose considerably in 2022, reaching 44GW, from 22GW in 2021.

Coal is still the main source of power production in APAC, due mainly to extensive coal reserves in mainland China and India.\\\\nApart from coal, fossil fuels’ installed capacity additions have remained relatively stable. In the last three years, fossil fuels have risen an average of 2% yearly, with coal accounting for 60% of the fossil fuel additions.\\\\nAPAC holds the biggest coal reserves in the world. However, despite renewable energy goals, coal phase-out targets in the region’s main economies are still far away. APAC’s total installed capacity is heavily concentrated in five markets. Mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea and Australia account for 89% of the region’s power matrix, at a combined capacity of 3.5TW.\\\\nSolar additions reached a new high of 47GW in 2022. Meanwhile, wind saw a slowdown, with 54GW of capacity added in 2022 against 62GW in 2021. To quickly meet rising demand, mainland China and India are focusing on solar deployment.

The continent’s abundant natural resources could drive the energy transition not only there but also internationally, by exporting clean power (especially to European markets) and thereby improving Africa’s own economic growth. However, so far, limited progress has been made.\\\\nFossil fuels dominate Africa’s power matrix, with natural gas accounting for 41% of capacity installed, followed by coal with 24%. Renewables have consistently grown over the decade and now account for 12% of the continent’s total capacity. Solar jumped from near-zero levels in 2012 to 16GW in 2022.\\\\nSolar has the potential to help close Africa’s electrification rate gap, as around three-quarters of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa still lacks access to reliable electricity. However, to allow PV to flourish, financial and regulatory barriers must be addressed.\\\\nAfrica’s total installed capacity is concentrated in just five economies, accounting for 72% of the region’s installed capacity, or 170GW.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Israel and Kuwait accounted for 217GW of installed capacity in 2022, or over 60% of the region’s capacity.\\\\nNevertheless, solar is the renewable source with the greatest potential in the region and has seen a consistent increase over the past years. The region boasts some of the best solar irradiation in the world. Solar jumped from basically nothing in 2012 to 19GW in 2022. Renewables overall have jumped sevenfold in just a decade.\\\\nNone of the five biggest Middle Eastern economies in terms of capacity have net-zero pledges.

Of this, two-thirds (200 GW) is represented by hydro. Solar follows in second place, having jumped to nearly 58GW in 2022, while wind accounts for around 41GW. Solar and wind are the main bets for responding to rising demand. Aligned with natural resources, growing incentives and policy frameworks, uptake is expected to keep rising in Latin American markets. BNEF expects Latin America to add over 115GW of wind and solar in the next five years.\\\\nBrazil leads renewables growth in the region. The market’s net-metering-fueled sub-5MW PV market continues to make an outsized contribution, accounting for nearly a third of all investment in renewables and half of all wind/solar build in 2022.

ICE phase-out targets by market Some 37 central governments have set dates to eliminate sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Another 34 regional and municipal authorities have such goals in force. The European Commission’s proposal to phase out ICE vehicle sales in the EU by 2035 adds another 11 markets to the former list. Regional and state-level ICE phase-out targets matter. Even targets that affect smaller geographical regions can signal to automakers and consumers the need to shift to zero-emission vehicles, especially in areas where market-wide mandates have yet to be implemented. Progress in setting ICE phase-out targets is slow in emerging markets. Of the five emerging markets with the biggest vehicle fleets – mainland China, India, Brazil, Mexico and Thailand, which together represented nearly 45% of global passenger vehicle sales in 2022 – only Mexico has an ICE phase-out on the books.

Heat pump sales rose only 1% from 2021 to 2022, to reach to 11 million units sold. That’s 7 percentage points less that the average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2012. In addition, heat pumps remain concentrated in just five markets – the US, Japan, mainland China, France and Italy – which together accounted for 81% of 2022 sales. Gas heating is typically cheaper than heat pumps for European households. However, the recent global energy crisis and subsequent volatility in electricity and gas prices have boosted heat pump sales, as have targeted subsidies.\\\\nWhen compared to traditional electric heaters, heat pump uptake usually leads to reduced energy consumption, as the technology produces two to three times more heat using the same amount of electricity.

India boasts the largest and most competitive auctions in the world, as well as one of the world’s highest renewable energy targets: 175GW by March 2022, and 500GW by 2030. As of year-end 2022, installed renewables capacity had reached 140GW – made up of 78GW of solar, 41GW of wind and 21GW from other clean sources excluding large hydro – or 80% of the 175GW goal. Since 2017, capacity additions from renewables have exceeded those of coal.\\\\nIndia’s position in the Climatescope ranking mainly reflects its fundamentals. Since 2012, it has implemented specific and efficient policies such as auctions, renewable energy targets and feed-in tariffs. These transparent mechanisms and ambitious government targets have attracted many domestic and foreign players, garnering around $47 billion in clean energy investment over the past five years.\\\\n1.

While it comes in second overall this year, it boasts the top score for Opportunities, a reflection of its massive potential for growth. We expect that by 2030, 35% of the world’s installed solar capacity and 50% of wind will have originated in the Asian giant. At the end of 2022, mainland China had 440GW of solar and 393GW of wind online, representing 33% of total installed capacity.\\\\nHowever, coal still dominates mainland China’s power system and accounted for nearly 44% of total installed capacity in 2022. Currently, 64% of the market’s generation comes from thermal sources, with coal alone accounting for almost 60% of that figure. Mainland China attracted 78% of emerging markets’ clean energy asset investment last year.

Moreover, significant volumes of renewable energy investment have helped make Chile attractive to clean energy investors. The market has already achieved its 20%-by-2025 target for clean power generation well in advance of the deadline, and the government is now discussing implementing a bolder target of 60% clean power generation in the upcoming years. While 44% of Chile’s generation currently comes from thermal sources, the market has committed to shuttering 1.7GW of coal-fired power by 2025 and completely phasing out coal by 2040. At the end of 2022, Chile had 7.3GW of solar and 3.9GW of wind online, representing 35% of its total installed capacity. Chile has attracted around $16 billion of clean energy investment over the past five years. This is mainly due to its well-structured power sector, which allows developers to sign bilateral contracts with large customers outside the regulated market, among other benefits.\\\\n3.

The market stands out as one of the few that have implemented auctions, feed-in tariffs, net-metering schemes, tax incentives and a strong target for renewable energy. In its second green energy auction, the Philippines awarded 3.4GW of renewable capacity out of the 11.6GW offered. From this, 1.2GW is earmarked for 2024-25 and will target ground-mounted and rooftop solar and onshore wind, and 2.2GW is earmarked for 2026. Currently, around 18% of the market’s total installed capacity comes from renewables, with wind accounting for 8%.

The escalating global population coupled with ongoing technological advancements perpetuates the surge in energy requirements (Kwon et al., 2016, Stringer et al., 2024). Projections indicate an annual growth rate in energy demand of approximately 1.8% by 2030. As of 2019, conventional fossil fuels have predominated as the primary source, accounting for over 80% of the global aggregate of primary energy consumption (Çakır, 2023, Tselika, 2022). However, the pervasive reliance on fossil fuel reserves engenders ecological concerns epitomized by phenomena such as global warming and the concomitant emission of greenhouse gases, exacerbating the specter of environmental degradation and precipitating significant proportions of energy conundrum significant proportions (Ukoba et al., 2024a).\\\\n\\\\nIn 2023, the global landscape of renewable energy was poised for a remarkable surge, with capacity additions projected to escalate substantially by 107 GW. This anticipated augmentation marks the most considerable absolute increase ever recorded, propelling the cumulative renewable capacity to surpass 440 GW (Joshi, 2021, Pata et al., 2024). To contextualize this surge, this figure illustrates the combined installed power capacities of both Germany and Spain. This unprecedented upswing reveals its impetus for multiple converging factors. First, expanding policy frameworks dedicated to renewable energy adoption serves as pivotal catalysts, fostering an environment conducive to its proliferation. Concurrently, mounting concerns regarding energy security, coupled with continuous improvement in the cost-competitiveness of renewable energy vis-à-vis fossil fuel alternatives, have contributed significantly to this trajectory (Nassar et al., 2024a, Nassar et al., 2024b, Puertas and Marti, 2022). These affirmative drivers eclipse the challenges posed by factors, such as escalating interest rates, heightened investment costs, and persistent hurdles within the renewable energy supply chain, ensuring the sustained momentum of this burgeoning sector (Khaleel et al., 2023a, Ntanos et al., 2018).\\\\n\\\\nIn an accelerated scenario, global renewable capacity additions are expected to surge, potentially reaching 550 GW by 2024. This forecast represents an approximately 20% increase compared with the projections outlined in the main forecast (Franke et al., 2024, Moriarty and Honnery, 2019, Zsiborács et al., 2019). The primary driving force behind this heightened trajectory is the expedited deployment of residential and commercial photovoltaic (PV) installations. This phenomenon is predicated on the assumption of a more rapid implementation of recent policies and incentives aimed at bolstering the adoption of renewable energy. The magnitude of expansion for utility-scale onshore wind and solar PV projects is contingent upon several key factors (Alasali et al., 2023, Blaabjerg and Ionel, 2015, Maruvala et al., 2024; Mohamed & Elbar, 2024), notably the expeditious processing of permitting procedures, timely execution of construction activities, and prompt integration of these projects into the existing grid infrastructure (Kabalci, 2024, Khaleel, 2023; Khaleel et al., 2022).\\\\n\\\\nThe anticipated augmentation of China\\'s contribution to global renewable capacity additions in the upcoming years, notably in 2023 and 2024, signifies a further consolidation of its paramount position as the foremost leader in worldwide deployment. By 2022, China will substantially dominate the landscape, accounting for nearly half of all newly installed renewable power capacities across the globe (Fu et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023). By the projected timeline of 2024, China\\'s commanding presence is poised to burgeon an unprecedented 55% share of the annual global renewable capacity deployment. China is slated to spearhead the majority of new offshore wind initiatives on a global scale, with an estimated contribution of nearly 70%. Additionally, the nation is anticipated to oversee more than 60% of onshore wind projects and approximately 50% of solar PV ventures by the same year (Ding, 2023, Hu et al., 2023, Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2023; Xin-gang & Ying, 2022).\\\\n\\\\nAccording to projections outlined in the 1.5°C scenario (Ding et al., 2023, Keyßer and Lenzen, 2021), the global aggregate of installed renewable power generation capacity is anticipated to undergo a substantial expansion by 2030, necessitating a more than three-fold increase from the 2022 figure of 3 382 GW to 11 174 GW. Specifically, the augmentation entails a marked rise in installed solar PV capacity, poised to exceed 5 400 GW, and a significant surge from the 2022 capacity of 1 055 GW. Additionally, wind installations are expected to surpass 3 500 GW, comprising 3 040 GW onshore and 500 GW offshore, reflecting a notable increase from 2022 to 899 GW (Aghahosseini et al., 2018, Chuang et al., 2019, Dadashi et al., 2022).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the proportion of variable renewable energy (VRE), including solar PV and wind power, in electricity generation is projected to increase from 10% of the total electricity generated in 2021 to 46% by 2030, thereby necessitating enhanced flexibility in the operational dynamics of the energy system. Beyond solar PV and wind power, the third largest upsurge in generation capacity is envisaged for hydropower (Aghahosseini et al., 2017, Knopf et al., 2015, Ram et al., 2018). By the year 2030, the global installed hydropower capacity is forecasted to expand by nearly 17% from the 2022 benchmark, reaching 1 465 GW under the ambit of the 1.5°C scenario. Fig. 1 demonstrates the global capacity for renewable electricity generation under the 1.5°C scenario, specifically for the years 2022-30, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nIt is imperative that there be an accelerated expansion of renewable power generation capacity, encompassing both grid-connected and off-grid systems, particularly within the developing world (Khaleel et al., 2025; Khaleel et al., 2023; Elweddad et al., 2022; Gui et al., 2024).\\\\n\\\\nOne significant contribution of this study is its comprehensive analysis and forecasting of renewable energy generation trends. By examining past developments and current trajectories, this article sheds light on the evolving landscape of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, and hydrogen. This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors driving the global growth of renewable energy generation, including technological advancements, policy frameworks, market dynamics, and environmental considerations.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the paper draws on various sources, including government reports, industry publications, and academic studies, to provide insights into the trajectory of renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass. It highlights the trends and predictions that shape the landscape of renewable energy generation worldwide. By synthesizing information and presenting detailed regional breakdowns in capacity growth, electricity demand trends, hydrogen capacity, and integration challenges, this study offers insights into how renewable energy trends manifest differently across various parts of the world. This detailed regional analysis contributes to the positioning of this manuscript within the broader literature on renewable energy forecasting and trends.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the article offers predictions for future trends in renewable energy generation, allowing policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers to anticipate and prepare for future developments. These predictions can serve as a guide for decision-making processes related to energy planning, investment strategies, and sustainable development initiatives.\\\\n\\\\nThis article comprehensively explores the dynamics of renewable energy. Section 2 presents a literature review and outlines projections for future growth along with opportunities and barriers to further advancement in renewable energy generation. Section 3 details the methodologies employed in the study, and Section 4 focuses on the phenomenon of renewable power growth. Section 5 discusses the rising global electricity demand and Section 6 explores the renewable capacity for hydrogen production. Section 7 investigates the integration of renewable energy into existing systems. Section 8 provides insights into the policies and market mechanisms that influence the development of renewable energy. Section 9 presents the study’s results and discussion, and Section 10 concludes the article by summarizing the key findings.\\\\n\\\\nSection snippets\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nLiterature review\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy sources have substantial potential for alleviating the energy access gap in developing countries through both grid-connected and off-grid solutions (Come Zebra et al., 2021, Kemausuor et al., 2018, Khaleel et al., 2022b, Siddaiah and Saini, 2016, Viole et al., 2023).\\\\n\\\\nNotwithstanding their abundant potential, numerous developing nations are confronted with a notable lag in the deployment of renewable power systems and associated investments.

The transition from conventional to renewable energy technology offers the optimal alternative solution to alleviate this significant issue. However, successful adoption of these technologies heavily depends on the consumers\\' willingness. This study aims to evaluate the factors influencing consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty. Additionally, this study added a further novel factor (crime concern) with the existing factors (belief about renewable technology benefits expectation, renewable energy technology cost, environmental concern, subjective norms) to the extended theory of planned behavior. The analysis confirmed that consumers\\' strong belief system, environmental concerns and subjective norms positively impact the consumers\\' willingness to adopt reliable and affordable renewable energy. Cost and crime concern negatively influence consumers\\' willingness to use this optimal technology. Interestingly, the findings of this study indicate that the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies has a notable impact on alleviating energy poverty. This study provides significant insights for governments, renewable energy technology manufacturers, and other relevant stakeholders to enhance the widespread uptake of renewable energy technology among consumers to achieve sustainable energy development goals in the context of energy poverty alleviation.\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nEnergy is a fundamental component of our universe; however, energy poverty is a prevalent environmental issue on a global scale. To mitigate its adverse effects, governments are implementing eco-friendly technologies worldwide \\\\\\\\[1\\\\\\\\]. The continuous growth in population and globalization has led to an escalation in energy demand \\\\\\\\[2\\\\\\\\]. Despite significant technological advancements, many countries continue to rely exclusively on crude oil as a primary source of electricity generation. The persistent utilization of conventional energy for electricity production is a critical component contributing to global warming \\\\\\\\[3\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nEnergy poverty depict the lack of clean and affordable energy access \\\\\\\\[4\\\\\\\\]. This issue has grabbed the predominant attention during the last few decades due to harmful effects on the environment and society \\\\\\\\[5\\\\\\\\]. Tanveer et al. (2021) evaluated that to mitigate the impact of global warming, the worldwide community needs to shift toward renewable and sustainable sources of energy. Renewable energy, such as biogas and solar power are affordable and clean energy sources \\\\\\\\[6\\\\\\\\]. Therefore, the positive attitude of consumers towards adopting renewable energy technology could effectively mitigate energy poverty \\\\\\\\[7\\\\\\\\]. Batool et al. (2022) analyzed that worldwide government prioritize renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty; however, its production and consumption progress is still deficient. Another study evaluated that a successful transition from conventional energy sources to renewable energy sources for alleviating energy poverty depends on the involvement of all stakeholders at multiple levels \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. Energy technology companies are crucial in facilitating the transition towards sustainable energy systems. The deployment of such technologies is highly dependent on collaboration and coordination among various entities such as organizations, stakeholders, and individuals. These actors support energy technology companies by offering expertise, resources, and access to networks vital for successful commercialization \\\\\\\\[9,10\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the contribution of consumers\\' role towards hastening and facilitating this transformation cannot be neglected. As end-users, consumers possess the ultimate decision-making power in choosing between conventional and renewable energy solutions \\\\\\\\[3\\\\\\\\]. The role of consumers in achieving environmental sustainability is crucial, as their consumption and production choices can serve as indicators of achieving zero energy poverty \\\\\\\\[11\\\\\\\\]. India is the second largest populated country, with 1.4 billion people \\\\\\\\[12\\\\\\\\]; energy is needed to support such a significant population and meet industrial needs \\\\\\\\[13\\\\\\\\]. Despite the considerable potential of renewable energy technology for electricity generation, the country still faces severe energy poverty \\\\\\\\[11\\\\\\\\]. India is categorized as a developing country and heavily depends on traditional energy sources, with 69\\xa0% of the population utilizing thermal electricity \\\\\\\\[14\\\\\\\\]. The country is investigating alternative energy sources to decrease its dependence on conventional energy and solve a deficit in energy supply and demand \\\\\\\\[15\\\\\\\\]. The Indian government has implemented many policies promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources \\\\\\\\[16\\\\\\\\]. RETs are the most rapidly expanding energy solution to mitigate worldwide energy crises \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. However, the inadequate provision of electricity has had a significant impact on both the economic growth and the standard of living of the population in India \\\\\\\\[17\\\\\\\\]. In addition, residential and commercial consumers utilize generators, uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), or rechargeable devices to fulfill their energy requirements during power outages, negatively impacting the country\\'s economy. The lack of electricity from the conventional power grid has compelled residential and commercial consumers to adopt renewable energy alternatives for their respective households and workplaces \\\\\\\\[9\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nIndia possesses abundant renewable energy potential, and their utilization can alleviate energy poverty. Despite having significant potential for energy production, the willingness to adopt RETs is at the initial stage in the country \\\\\\\\[8\\\\\\\\]. Many factors, such as the high initial cost, the inadequate policy framework, the complexity of the technology, and the lack of public knowledge, contribute to the low acceptance rate of RETs \\\\\\\\[3,9,16,18\\\\\\\\]. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on identifying the potential and accessibility of various renewable energy sources in India \\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\[19\\\\\\\\], \\\\\\\\[20\\\\\\\\], \\\\\\\\[21\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\]. Another study evaluated RETs\\' impact on economic growth \\\\\\\\[22,23\\\\\\\\]. Pathak et al. (2022) assessed and prioritized the barriers that impede the development of renewable energy technologies and provided solutions to overcome these barriers in India \\\\\\\\[16\\\\\\\\]. Another prior studies investigated the fact that renewable energy technologies (RETs) are a viable alternative to mitigating carbon emissions in a given country \\\\\\\\[24,25\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nFirst, this current research significantly contributes to the extant literature focusing on the transition from conventional to renewable energy technologies to alleviate energy poverty. Second, India has the renewable energy potential. The current research explores the factors affecting the consumer willingness to adopt the RETs; no prior studies have been done in the Indian context. Third, this study used the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and added a novel factor to understand the consumer willingness to adopt the RETs. Because producing renewable energy technology is not a sign of alleviating energy poverty, it is necessary to consume affordable energy sources to maintain sustainable energy. Therefore, measuring the factors influencing the consumers\\' willingness to adopt the RETs to alleviate energy poverty is essential. This research added a novel element (crime concern) with the existing factors (belief about renewable technology benefits expectation, renewable energy technology cost, environmental concern, subjective norms) to assess the consumer willingness to adopt RETs in the Indian context. Crime is a big issue that impedes consumers\\' willingness to uptake renewable energy. This research will be innovative because no researcher focuses on this main factor. It is the primary research that is contributing novel work to fill the research gap. Furthermore, this research will provide a new dimension to environmentalists, stakeholders, and policymakers to alleviate energy poverty by evaluating consumer behaviors, because studying energy poverty and its link with renewable energy is not enough.\\\\n\\\\nSection 2 presents the theoretical framework, and section 3 develops the hypothesis based on an extensive literature review. Section 4 consists of the research methodology, which defines the data collection technique and tools for data analysis. Section 5 consisted of the empirical results based on measurement and structural models. Section 6 presented discussions and implications regarding the relevant suggestions to motivate the positive influencing factors and demotivate the negative influencing factors to enhance the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technology in the context of energy poverty alleviation. Finally, the 7 section presents the conclusion and policy recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nSection snippets\\\\n----------------\\\\n\\\\nTheoretical framework\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technology, many theoretical models have been used in previous studies, such as the theory of reason action model that was introduced by Martin Fishbein in 1967 \\\\\\\\[26\\\\\\\\], the theory of self-efficacy developed by Albert Bandura in 1977 \\\\\\\\[27\\\\\\\\] and theory of planned behavior (TPB) by Icek Ajzen in 1991 \\\\\\\\[28\\\\\\\\]. TPB, on the other hand, is a frequently used model that predicts and evaluates consumer behavior. According to this theory, a person\\'s\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment of research hypotheses\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nBased on the justification of previous literature, we have developed five hypotheses.\\\\n\\\\nProcess of data collection\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe survey questionnaire used various questions to measure the factors affecting consumer willingness to adopt renewable energy technology. The data was collected from October 2022 to January 2023 in five major cities of India (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad, Ahmedabad). A five-point Likert scale data was used to evaluate the constructs items. Data was collected from 620 dwellers by using convenient random sampling techniques. Most of the questionnaire items were formed based on a\\\\n\\\\nMeasurement model analysis\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe result findings show that all scale items\\' internal consistency is satisfactory; the analysis results demonstrate that all variables have composite reliability coefficients \\\\\\\\>0.7, such as BRETBE (0.924), CRMC (0.769), ENVC (0.873), SUBN (0.907), RETC (0.898), ENPA (0.935), and WTARET (0.798). Furthermore, the Cronbach\\'s alpha test depicted that internal consistency is satisfactory such as all variables\\' values are \\\\\\\\>0.7, such as BRETBE (0.921), CRMC (0.766), ENVC (0.871), SUBN (0.904), RETC\\\\n\\\\nDiscussions and implications\\\\n----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThis study has theoretical and practical implications by recognizing the factors influencing the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies in the context of energy poverty alleviation. This study evaluated the study framework to alleviate energy poverty by motivating and demotivating the consumers\\' influencing factors to adopt RETs. This study used the theory of planned behavior to assess multifactor influencing the consumers\\' willingness to adopt renewable energy in the\\\\n\\\\nConclusions and policy recommendations\\\\n--------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy technologies (RETs) have the potential to alleviate energy poverty. However, a lack of research impedes the consumer\\'s willingness to adopt RETs. We added more significant constructs to the TPB theoretical framework.

In this study, a comprehensive analysis of 13 policy components across three categories of environmental policies, namely, market-based policies, non-market-based policies, and technology support policies, in 19 representative OECD countries from 2004 to 2020, was conducted. Random Forest models were employed to explore the relationships between these policy components and the share of energy from renewable sources. The study successfully identifies the nonlinear relationships, and highlights the varying impact of environmental policy components at different levels. Results indicate that the carbon dioxide tax, expenditure on low-carbon research and development, and the particulate matter emission limit are the most influential components in the model. Analysis of interaction effects across policy categories showed that the combination of the carbon dioxide tax and solar energy support yields the most remarkable synergistic effects on increasing the share of energy from renewable sources. Conversely, the coupling of the carbon dioxide tax with the particulate matter emission limit exhibits strong antagonistic effects. These findings advance knowledge by quantifying relative policy importance, threshold effects, and interactions, bridging gaps in understanding how distinct policy components drive renewable energy transitions. This study identifies key policy stringency levels for achieving specific renewable energy targets and recommends that policymakers adopt a well-coordinated policy mix, considering the potential synergistic and antagonistic effects, to achieve more effective outcomes and mitigate policy conflicts.\\\\n    \\\\n*   ### [Farmers’ Willingness to Achieve Energy Self-Sufficiency in

This shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources underscores the urgency and growing commitment to sustainable power generation across the globe. The article will delve into the surge of global investment in renewable energy, highlight the technological advancements propelling its adoption, and explore the varied regional patterns and challenges. Furthermore, it aims to project the future outlook for renewable energy adoption, focusing on the critical role of investment trends and government incentives in shaping a greener power grid. Global investment in renewable energy Record-Breaking investments in renewable energy In 2023, global investment in the energy transition surged to an unprecedented $1.8 trillion, marking a 17% increase from the previous year. This substantial financial commitment underscores the growing global emphasis on sustainable energy solutions. Notably, investment in renewable energy itself reached $623 billion, reflecting an 8% increase, highlighting a robust commitment to transitioning away from fossil fuels. Leading contributors and investment areas China continued to dominate the landscape as the largest market for energy transition investment, contributing a staggering 38% of the global total. In contrast, the United States and the European Union also demonstrated significant growth, with investments totaling $303 billion and $360 billion, respectively. These investments are pivotal in driving the shift towards a more sustainable and resilient global power grid. The rise of solar energy and electrified transport Solar energy investments reached a new high of $380 billion in 2023, surpassing investments in upstream oil sectors. This shift not only reflects the cost-effectiveness of solar energy but also its increasing viability as a primary energy source. Additionally, the investment in electrified transport soared to $634 billion, accounting for more than a third of the total investment in the energy transition, which indicates a rapid move towards electric vehicles and other forms of clean transportation. Financing climate goals and the role of the private sector The private sector has emerged as a critical player, providing around 75% of total renewable energy investments from 2013 to 2020. Institutional investors, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, are increasingly recognized for their potential to scale up investments in renewable energy. Furthermore, green bonds have become pivotal in bridging the gap between capital providers and renewable energy projects, facilitating increased investments in this sector. Challenges and future needs Despite these positive trends, the investment in renewable energy needs to triple to meet essential climate and development goals. Current investments remain concentrated in a few countries and technologies, indicating a need for more diversified investment strategies. Moreover, sound policy frameworks are essential to attract further private sector investment and to ensure that these funds are channeled effectively to foster global energy transition. By addressing these challenges and leveraging the momentum of current investment trends, the global community can ensure a sustainable and equitable energy future, aligning with the goals of reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security worldwide. Discover: Why Compliance and Legal AI is Revolutionizing the Industry Technological advancements driving adoption Heat pumps and electric vehicles: catalysts for change The renewable energy sector has witnessed remarkable growth in heat pump sales and electric vehicle (EV) adoption. Since 2021, global heat pump sales have experienced double-digit annual growth, and 2023 anticipates a further increase in EV sales by a third.

This is the 22nd year in a row that renewable capacity additions set a new record. While the increases in renewable capacity in Europe, the United\\xa0States and Brazil hit all-time highs, China’s acceleration was extraordinary. In 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, while its wind additions also grew by 66% year-on-year. Globally, solar PV alone accounted for three-quarters of renewable capacity additions worldwide. Achieving the COP28 target of tripling global renewable capacity by 2030 hinges on policy implementation Prior to the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai, the International Energy Agency (IEA) urged governments to support five pillars for action by 2030, among them the goal of tripling global renewable power capacity. Several of the IEA priorities were reflected in the Global Stocktake text agreed by the 198\\xa0governments at COP28, including the goals of tripling renewables and doubling the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030. Tripling global renewable capacity in the power sector from 2022 levels by 2030 would take it above 11 000 GW, in line with IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario. Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7\\xa0300\\xa0GW by 2028. This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5\\xa0times its current level by 2030, falling short of the tripling goal. Governments can close the gap to reach over 11\\xa0000\\xa0GW by 2030 by overcoming current challenges and implementing existing policies more quickly. These challenges fall into four main categories and differ by country: 1)\\xa0policy uncertainties and delayed policy responses to the new macroeconomic environment; 2)\\xa0insufficient investment in grid infrastructure preventing faster expansion of renewables; 3)\\xa0cumbersome administrative barriers and permitting procedures and social acceptance issues; 4)\\xa0insufficient financing in emerging and developing economies. This report’s accelerated case shows that addressing those challenges can lead to almost 21% higher growth of renewables, pushing the world towards being on track to meet the global tripling pledge. What is needed to reach the collective target to triple renewables by 2030 varies significantly by country and region. G20\\xa0countries account for almost 90% of global renewable power capacity today. In the accelerated case, which assumes enhanced implementation of existing policies and targets, the G20 could triple their collective installed capacity by 2030. As such, they have the potential to contribute significantly to tripling renewables globally. However, to achieve the global goal, the rate of new installations needs to accelerate in other countries, too, including many emerging and developing economies outside the G20, some of which do not have renewable targets and/or supportive policies today. The global power mix will be transformed by 2028 The world is on course to add more renewable capacity in the next five years than has been installed since the first commercial renewable energy power plant was built more than 100\\xa0years ago. In the main case forecast in this report, almost 3\\xa0700\\xa0GW of new renewable capacity comes online over the 2023‑2028 period, driven by supportive policies in more than 130\\xa0countries.

The United States is accelerating its renewable energy transition, driven by federal policies like the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates $370 billion to clean energy initiatives. Solar and wind power are key beneficiaries, with tax credits and grants incentivizing rapid adoption. Globally, investments in low-carbon energy hit $1.1 trillion in 2022, according to BloombergNEF, while the U.S. clean energy sector is projected to create millions of jobs by 2030. Yet challenges persist. In February 2023, 60% of U.S. electricity still came from fossil fuels, versus 21.5% from renewables—a disconnect between policy goals and real-world implementation. How do Americans view this transition?We surveyed 400+ U.S. adults to explore: Familiarity with solar, wind, and hydropower. Willingness to adopt renewables. Key barriers (cost, awareness, accessibility). The results offer actionable insights for businesses and policymakers navigating this critical decade for climate action. Outlook Toward Renewable Energy in the US Solar energy is the most recognized renewable source among Americans (73%), followed by wind (48%) and hydropower (30%). However, the U.S. is the world’s second-largest renewable energy producer, trailing only China. Actual usage tells a different story: solar accounts for just 16% of U.S. renewable electricity generation, while wind (48%) and hydropower (29%) dominate. Wind power alone generated 10% of the nation’s total electricity in 2022, underscoring its outsized role. Together, renewables supplied 21.5% of total U.S. electricity in early 2023, per the Energy Information Administration. The majority of Americans also showed a positive perception of renewable energy in the US. The data reflecting a combined percentage of 64.1% for ‘positive’ and ‘very positive’ responses indicates a prevailing shift in attitudes towards renewable energy in the US. This shift can be attributed to various factors, including heightened awareness of climate change, increased education about the benefits of renewable energy, and the growing emphasis on sustainable living. A 2022 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication revealed that younger Americans are becoming more concerned about global warming than they were a decade ago. Why Americans Want to Switch to Renewable Energy Current Adoption Trends Today, 30% of Americans use renewable energy at home or work—but nearly the same percentage (30%) are unsure whether their energy sources are clean. Among adopters, 70% rely on solar power, primarily through rooftop panels, highlighting its visibility in residential markets. By contrast, solar accounts for just 16% of utility-scale renewable electricity, reflecting slower institutional adoption. Sentiment Toward Transition Public enthusiasm is rising: 32.5% of Americans are open to adopting renewables, while only 7% oppose the idea entirely. Advocacy is even stronger: 66.5% would recommend renewables to others, with 36% being passionate advocates. Resistance is minimal, with less than 10% expressing reluctance. Key Drivers of AdoptionThree factors dominate decision-making: Cost (64%): Affordability remains critical. Accessibility (50%): Options must be widely available. Environmental Impact (41%): Climate concerns influence choices. This disconnect—strong public support but lagging infrastructure—suggests a cultural shift outpacing systemic change. Challenges Hindering the Adoption 1. Cost Barriers44% of Americans cite affordability as the top hurdle. For example, residential solar panel installations cost $4,500–$36,000 (averaging $16,000), with pricing shaped by home size, location, and equipment efficiency (Forbes). 2. Awareness Gaps1 in 4 respondents lacks basic knowledge about renewable options, while 11% fear technical hurdles like installation complexity or grid integration issues (e.g., inconsistent energy storage). 3. Systemic InertiaWhile households embrace rooftop solar, utility-scale adoption lags. Bridging this gap requires simpler processes, public-private partnerships, and consumer education campaigns. To Wrap Up The U.S. energy landscape is changing rapidly. Federal investments like the Inflation Reduction Act—which dedicates $370 billion to clean energy—are accelerating this shift.

Renewable energy is increasingly becoming a vital component of the energy mix of the 21st century, and its successful penetration of the market is already underway in many EU Member States. This publication examines examples of successful implementation of renewable energy projects through case studies and analysis of EU Member State policies and activities. The experiences described may help policy implementers in the Member States to learn from each other’s experiences. We hope these success stories will breed further successes. I believe that this publication could be useful not only to EU decision makers and policy implementers but also to all countries interested in increasing their levels of renewable energy sources. The report sheds light on the factors that led to successful implementation of some renewable energy technologies in some EU Member States and emphasizes the wide range of factors that can determine whether projects succeed or not. All examples studied are reported following the same methodology and format, thus creating a framework for reporting on success stories that others could also use as a communication tool for promoting renewables. This document is also available in electronic format on the Agency’s main web site at http://reports.eea.eu.int/ as well as in EnviroWindows, an EEA web site for gathering and disseminating information on environmental management and best practices, aimed at businesses, local authorities and their stakeholders (http://ewindows.eu.org/ LocalAuthorities/renewables.pdf). It is my hope that this report will become the seed for the creation of a clearing house for experiences in how best to promote renewable energies at many levels, from national to local. The Agency is offering its electronic space and expertise to anybody who would like to pick up the gauntlet and create a permanent site where success stories on implementation of renewable energies are reported in a standardised way and updated when new data become available.\\\\nI would like to thank the manager of this report, Aphrodite Mourelatou, for the valuable work she put into this project; Ecotec Research and Consulting Ltd, who assisted with writing the report; Eurostat, which provided the necessary data; and all others who contributed to the report or reviewed it.\\\\nDomingo Jiménez-Beltrán Executive Director 4 Renewable energies: success stories Contents Foreword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Executive summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.\\\\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2.\\\\nBackground . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 2.1.\\\\nThe importance of renewable energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 2.2.\\\\nTargets for renewable energy use in the EU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2.2.1.

By analysing these cases it seeks to understand the factors that influence the success of renewable energy schemes and to facilitate their widespread penetration in the Member States. The study aims to provide policy-makers and policy implementers with an opportunity to learn from each others\\' experiences, and thereby to contribute to EU and Member State efforts to meet their renewable energy indicative targets for 2010.\\\\nIdentifying progress in renewable energy deployment The study evaluates the rate of penetration in each EU Member State of four renewable energy sources — photovoltaics, solar thermal, wind and biomass (as biomass power, biomass district heating and biofuels) — between 1993 and 1999. For consistency purposes only data from Eurostat (the statistical office of the European Communities) have been used. For the purposes of this study, two selection criteria have been applied to identify those Member State/technology combinations where renewable energy has penetrated to a greater degree of success than in others: • An absolute increase equivalent to at least 10 % of the total EU-wide increase in renewable energy output of that particular technology over the period 1993–99. The 10 % threshold has been selected to identify those Member States that made the greatest contribution to the increase in renewable energy output of each technology in the EU.\\\\n• A percentage increase of renewable energy output of the examined technology greater than the EU percentage increase for that technology between 1993–1999. This compares the percentage increase of each renewable energy source with the EU-wide percentage increase, and identifies those Member State/technology combinations which exceeded the EU-wide figure.\\\\nThis approach enables the identification of those Member State/technology combinations where exploitation of the technology was well established in 1993 and continued to expand over the next six years. It also highlights Member States where a technology was in an initial stage of development at the start of the six-year period and achieved a rapid rate of increase in penetration, but still only provides a limited quantity of energy output.\\\\nIt should be noted that the criteria cannot be used to directly benchmark a country\\'s performance in promoting renewable energies. The study focuses on positive changes during the period studied, and does not compare absolute levels of penetration.\\\\nThe results of applying these two criteria are summarised in the table below.\\\\nExecutive summary 7 Biomass district heating refers to heat output from heat plants only.\\\\nNote 1: Two criteria for selection are used: ! (left) represents a contribution of at least 10 % of the total EU increase in absolute terms, 1993–99; ! (right) represents a percentage increase greater than the EU percentage increase, 1993–99.\\\\nNote 2: Biofuels only: ! represents those Member States which indicate that they use biofuels (most do not).\\\\nThe results show wide variations between the 15 Member States (see Table 3 on page 21).\\\\nFor most technologies, only two or three Member States contributed more than 10 % (each) of the total new output from the technology: — Germany and Spain contributed 78 % of new EU output from photovoltaics; — Austria, Germany and Greece contributed 80 % of new solar thermal installations; — Denmark, Germany and Spain contributed 80 % of new wind output; — Finland and Sweden contributed 60 % of new generation from biomass-fuelled power stations (including biomass combined heat and power stations); — Austria and Sweden dominated the increase in output from biomass district heating installations; — only four Member States use biofuels to any significant extent; France is the market leader, producing about 40 % of the total.\\\\nMore Member States, however, were starting to expand their rates of exploitation of certain technologies, and had a percentage increase greater than the EU figure. Indeed, some Member States with low initial levels of renewable energy use demonstrated rapid growth rates even though the actual increase in output achieved was small over the period.\\\\nOnly a small number of Member State/technology combinations met both criteria. Germany achieved the greatest levels of new renewable energy penetration over the period and met both criteria for all of the technologies studied except biomass. There were also positive combinations in Austria, Spain and Sweden.\\\\nSuccess factors The study drew on the considerable amount of previous work carried out at EU and Member State level on the barriers that hinder the implementation of renewable energies. It identifies a number of potential success factors likely to have a positive influence on the development of renewable energy technologies.\\\\nTrends in renewable energy penetration, 1993–99 Technology: Selection criteria (see note 1): Photo-voltaics Solar thermal Wind Biomass: power Biomass: district heating (1993–98) Biomass: biofuels (see note 2) Austria ! !\\\\n!\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\nBelgium !\\\\nDenmark !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nFinland !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nFrance !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nGermany ! !\\\\n! !\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nGreece !\\\\nIreland !\\\\n!\\\\nItaly !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nLuxembourg Netherlands !\\\\n!\\\\nPortugal !\\\\nSpain ! !\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\nSweden !\\\\n!\\\\n! !\\\\nUK !\\\\nSource: Eurostat.\\\\n8 Renewable energies: success stories The study examines the influence of these potential success factors in a series of case studies selected from the Member State/technology combinations that have been identified by applying the selection criteria summarised in the table above. In particular, it examines all Member State/technology combinations that met both of the criteria for successful penetration and the most interesting Member State/technology combinations meeting one of the criteria. Where possible and appropriate, representative examples of renewable energy projects have been used in the case studies.\\\\nThe following conclusions summarise the results of the analysis carried out, based on the case studies.\\\\nNo single factor was identified as being of overwhelming significance. It is rather the cumulative benefits of a series of supportive measures that determine the extent to which a renewable technology is successfully exploited. There are, however, certain essential components of successful renewable energy implementation that help to create an environment in which renewable energy exploitation can succeed.\\\\nThese are described below under the following seven sub-headings: political; legislative; fiscal, financial; administrative; technological development; information, education and training: Political support • The EU countries which showed a rapid expansion of renewable energy during the 1990s are most commonly those with long-established policies in support of renewable energy in general or of a particular renewable energy.\\\\nRegional energy policies can also contribute towards encouraging renewable energy development. For Member States with a high degree of regional autonomy, such as Austria, Germany and Spain, many regional authorities have brought forward energy plans that are even more supportive towards renewable energy than those at the national level.\\\\nLegislative support • For electricity from renewable sources, the feed-in law system has given a great impetus to renewable energy developments, in particular wind energy. This system combines commercially favourable guaranteed feed-in tariffs with an obligation on utilities to purchase renewable electricity at these tariffs.\\\\nDenmark, Germany and Spain (all countries using the feed-in law system) contributed 80 % of new wind energy output in the EU-15 over the period 1993–99.\\\\nBiomass use in power stations also benefited from feed-in laws, particularly in these same three countries. However, the expansion of biomass power has not been as rapid as that of wind. Biomass use also increased significantly in some Member States without the support of a feed-in mechanism (Finland and Sweden). Successful biomass development benefits from feed-in tariffs but is also closely linked with other success factors, especially the availability of financial support (see below).\\\\nThe use of photovoltaics expanded significantly in those Member States that provided a high level of support to projects through feed-in arrangements — the most successful being Germany and Spain. However, successful penetration occurred where the feed-in support initiatives were implemented together with capital subsidy programmes to encourage uptake of the technology (again Germany and, to a lesser extent, Spain).\\\\nThe main alternative to the feed-in mechanism is the competitive tendering process. This system was chosen by Ireland and the UK (1) to support a range of technologies, including wind and biomass, and by France (2) to support wind energy. Developers are guaranteed that, if they win the tender, their power will be purchased at the price they bid in their proposal. This resulted in an increase in capacity of a range of renewable energy technologies in these (1) The UK is replacing the competitive tendering system with a Renewables Obligation, under which suppliers are legally obliged to provide an increasing proportion of their supplies from renewable sources.\\\\n(2) From June 2001 France replaced competitive tendering with a system similar to the feed-in law.\\\\nExecutive summary 9 Member States, but not to the same extent as was achieved where feed-in arrangements were available. Compared with feed-in arrangements in other Member States, the competitive nature of the tendering system has offered fewer guarantees to developers that they will receive an acceptable tariff rate for their project.\\\\n• Renewable energy power generators need grid access to be able to distribute the electricity generated. This requires the establishment of transparent and reasonable charging structures so they can operate successfully within the electricity supply system.\\\\nMember States that took the biggest steps to address problems of grid access achieved the greatest levels of renewable electricity penetration during the 1990s, especially for smaller-scale renewable energy projects.\\\\nGrid access is an important component of the recently adopted EU directive (3) on renewable energy in the internal electricity market. The directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity produced from renewable sources and encourages such electricity to be given priority access to the grid.\\\\nFiscal support • Fiscal (taxation) measures are increasingly being used as a mechanism to reward the environmental benefits of renewable energy compared with energy generated from fossil sources.\\\\nDuring the period of this study, at least six Member States — Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands and Sweden — put in place some form of energy-related taxation which penalises the use of fossil fuels or other environmentally damaging activities. In Sweden, the introduction of taxes on carbon dioxide emissions and energy from which biomass is exempted helped the expansion of both biomass district heating and biomass combined heat and power plants. The taxes made other options, in particular coal-fired district heating and coal-fired combined heat and power plants, more expensive.\\\\nAn alternative fiscal approach developed in other Member States is to allow various tax exemptions or reductions for individuals or companies who invest in or use renewable-related products or services. The installation of solar thermal water-heating systems has been stimulated by this approach (in Greece, for example). Individual investors in wind energy benefit from tax exemptions in Germany and Sweden, while Dutch companies benefit from accelerated depreciation for investment in energy-saving schemes that include renewable projects.\\\\nBiofuels for transport represent a special example of the role of fiscal initiatives to support renewable energy. Some Member States took advantage of opportunities to apply lower fuel excise duty rates to support biofuels. France in particular used this option to stimulate the growth of the EU’s largest biofuels industry.\\\\nFinancial support • The capital costs of renewable energy projects, which are often high, can be a significant barrier to development, especially for newer technologies. Subsidies or favourable loans for renewable energy developments are common where successful penetration occurs.\\\\nWind energy has become increasingly cost-competitive over the 1990s, and grants are required less often where feed-in arrangements are available. Where such arrangements are not available, subsidies are still the main mechanism for successfully supporting wind energy schemes.\\\\nBiomass installations usually still need capital subsidy to be financially viable as they have high capital costs. This is true even in countries with feed-in arrangements. For example, capital (3) Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (2001/77/EC).\\\\n10 Renewable energies: success stories grants are provided for biomass power schemes in Germany to augment feed-in tariffs, but for wind power only limited grants are currently provided.\\\\nPhotovoltaics (PV) is still an immature technology and projects need considerable subsidy. Member States showing significant increases in PV use are those that have established subsidy support mechanisms, usually in association with feed-in tariff arrangements.\\\\nSolar thermal installations are not always able to compete on costs with fossil fuel heating sources and require subsidies to achieve a high level of uptake. Substantial subsidies were made available to households or industry in the three Member States showing the greatest level of development of solar thermal power over the period of this study (Austria, Germany and Greece).\\\\nAdministrative support • Successful replication of renewable energy projects can be achieved on a wide scale only where there is active support for renewable energy at the level at which individual projects are brought forward for approval. In most cases this is the local or regional level. Administrative support at national level is also an important component for success.\\\\nThe case studies identified a wide range of ways in which local or regional administrations or municipalities have successfully supported renewable energy uptake, including: — developing local or regional targets for renewable energy uptake; — providing planning guidance for locating renewable projects; — providing funding support for local renewable energy projects; — improving building regulations to stimulate uptake of photovoltaics or solar thermal installations; — implementing district heating schemes; — supporting the development of new indigenous manufacturing capacity.\\\\nSome of the projects studied received a strong level of public sector support at regional or local level. This shows the regional or local authorities’ appreciation of the benefits that the projects would bring to the local population not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of economic development and employment.\\\\nTechnological development • The development of renewable energy technologies requires support at all stages — research, demonstration and implementation — to help achieve strong and competitive indigenous industry capabilities in renewable energy.\\\\nPublic sector funding to develop renewable energy has been provided over the past 20 years, both by the European Commission and at Member State level. This support has helped to achieve considerable cost reductions and technological improvements. Member States that have focused national research funding support towards specific technologies are now reaping the rewards of this investment. For example, Denmark now has the world’s leading wind industry, Finland and Sweden have strong capabilities in biomass technologies, and Germany and the Netherlands are home to photovoltaic cell manufacturing.\\\\nInformation, education and training • Activities that raise awareness of the benefits of renewable energy among the general public are a vital component of national, regional and local renewable energy support programmes.\\\\nThe success of a renewable energy project, and its subsequent replication, ultimately depends on its public acceptability at local level. At this level, communicating the non-energy benefits is an important component in the acceptability of renewable energy, especially its role in providing revenue and local jobs. Cooperative participation in a project can be a successful way of involving the local community in a new renewable energy development. The role of the developer could also be important for public acceptance and requires that developers Executive summary 11 work with the local community to provide information about the nature of new renewable energy projects and their potential benefits.\\\\nEnergy agencies at local or regional level are one of the most successful initiatives to help raise public awareness of the benefits of renewable energy and increase public acceptance of new renewable energy developments. Their role is to stimulate the expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency in their area through public and private sector initiatives and local community involvement.\"}, {\"title\": \"2025 Renewable Energy Trends in Asia\", \"url\": \"https://energytracker.asia/renewable-energy-trends-in-asia/\", \"content\": \"Fossil Fuel\\\\n       Coal\\\\n       Oil and Gas\\\\n       Petroleum\\\\n       Natural Gas\\\\n       Hydrogen\\\\n       Greenwashing\\\\n\\\\n   Region\\\\n       Southeast Asia\\\\n           Bangladesh\\\\n           Cambodia\\\\n           Indonesia\\\\n           India\\\\n           Malaysia\\\\n           Philippines\\\\n           Singapore\\\\n           Thailand\\\\n           Vietnam\\\\n\\\\n       East Asia\\\\n           Japan\\\\n           South Korea\\\\n\\\\n       Others\\\\n\\\\n   Blog\\\\n       Case Studies\\\\n       Energy Transition Inspiration\\\\n       Opinion Pieces [...] In a nutshell, there are just a handful of markets where the technology is proving economically feasible.

Region\\\\n\\\\n1998\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 2: Notice of Change](https://energytracker.asia/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ETA-Website-Banner-970x90-1.png)![Image 3: Notice of Change](blob:http://localhost/48e93ae359c1b000173be7c37965357f)](https://energytracker.asia/privacy-policy/)\\\\n\\\\n2025 Renewable Energy Trends in the Asia Pacific Region\\\\n=======================================================\\\\n\\\\n Aside from leading the world in solar PV and onshore wind deployment, the Asia-Pacific region, led by China, will also accelerate the deployment and further increase innovations in alternative clean energy technologies such as offshore wind, floating solar and green hydrogen. \\\\n\\\\n26 January 2025 – by _Viktor Tachev_**Comments (0)**\\\\n\\\\nLanguages (English)\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will once again set the **renewable energy trends** for the global energy transition. From increased solar PV and onshore wind deployment to advancing green technologies such as offshore wind power, floating solar, batteries, EVs and green hydrogen, Asia will again lead the global decarbonisation journey. The initial signs are that this won’t fly under the radar of energy transition investors, who will continue to look favourably toward the Asia Pacific as the preferred region for their investments.\\\\n\\\\n**The Top Renewable Energy Trends in Asia in 2025**\\\\n---------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, China is likely to surpass its target of having 1,200 GW of clean power by 2030, reaching [1,500 GW](https://ember-energy.org/data/2030-global-renewable-target-tracker/), while its CO 2 emissions have already peaked or will do so in [2025](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/chinas-co2-emissions-have-peaked-or-will-in-2025-say-44-of-experts-in-survey). Projections reveal that between now and 2030, China will account for nearly [60%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/09/china-to-head-green-energy-boom-with-60-of-new-projects-in-next-six-years) of all renewable energy capacity installed worldwide. By the decade’s end, the country will have over 50% of the world’s renewables. Alongside India, it will be the engine behind the accelerated deployment of renewables. Between now and 2030, clean energy is expected to roll out at three times the pace of the previous six years.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels today exceeds [80%](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary). The country is also home to the world’s top 10 solar PV manufacturing equipment suppliers and has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV. According to the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary), the world will almost completely rely on China to supply key building blocks for solar panel production through 2025.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to wind, the [Global Wind Energy Council](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf) finds that the onshore wind capacity in the APAC region could more than double to 1,084 GW by the decade’s end.\\\\n\\\\nNot only will ground-mounted solar PV and onshore wind energy capacity be deployed faster than ever in Asia, but accompanying green technologies will make major leaps.\\\\n\\\\n### **1.****Offshore Wind**\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the [Global Wind Energy Council](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf), the Asia-Pacific region possesses some of the most attractive onshore and offshore wind resources globally and could play a pivotal role in the global energy transition. By 2030, over 122 GW of new capacity could come online, taking the cumulative regional total to 162 GW.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other green technologies, China will be by far the largest onshore and offshore wind market. By 2030, China will have around 130 GW of offshore wind. Japan and South Korea have already held offshore wind auctions, with the first awarded projects to come online from 2026, deploying 4 and 6 GW, respectively. Vietnam is working towards deploying 6 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 70–91.5 GW by 2050. From 2024 to 2030, operational offshore wind capacity in APAC is set to increase sixfold.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAPAC Offshore Wind Supply Chain Potential by 2030. Source: [GWEC](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, [APAC’s wind turbine supply](https://energynews.pro/en/wind-turbines-booming-in-asia-pacific-challenges-for-western-manufacturers/) dwarfs that of manufacturers from the rest of the world. Furthermore, most of the demand comes from within the region, positioning the local industry for significant growth in the upcoming years.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, to maximise the region’s potential and meet the 2030 targeted wind installations, GWEC recommends that APAC governments prioritise scaling up regional supply chains. Crucial on that front would be increasing the public support for supply chain capacity building outside of auctions to boost resilience and ease the price pressure on developers. According to experts, international collaboration to scale up the floating wind supply chain would also be of great importance. South Korea’s [Floating Wind](https://koreafloatingwind.kr/en-home) project, which will consist of between 60 and 100 wind turbines, with power expected in 2028, and [Doosan Enerbility’s Changwon plant](https://www.equinor.co.kr/en/news/equinor-signs-mou-with-siemens-gamesa-and-doosan-enerbility-on-ulsan-bandibuli-floating-offshore-wind-project) are shining examples of global cooperation in the field.\\\\n\\\\n### **2. Floating and Rooftop Solar****Panels**\\\\n\\\\n[Wood Mackenzie](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/11/20/wood-mackenzie-forecasts-77-gw-of-floating-solar-by-2033/) projects that APAC will be home to nine of the top 10 global floating solar markets. Together, they will account for 57 of the 77 GW of installed floating solar capacity globally by 2033. India, China and Indonesia will be the three largest markets.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, China already opened the [world’s largest](https://www.pv-tech.org/chinas-chn-energy-completes-worlds-largest-open-sea-floating-solar-pv-project/) open-sea floating solar project – a 1 GW power plant in the Shandong Province. However, growth is also expected in Southeast Asian countries.\\\\n\\\\n[Rystad Energy](https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/floating-pv-southeast-asia) expects floating PV to play a key role in Southeast Asia’s solar expansion, accounting for 10% of the region’s total solar capacity by 2030. The experts identify the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand as the countries leading this growing trend.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nSource: [Rystad Energy](https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/floating-pv-southeast-asia)\\\\n\\\\nVietnam has emerged as the [world’s second-leading](https://www.statista.com/statistics/668749/regional-distribution-of-solar-pv-module-manufacturing/) solar panel manufacturer after China and plans to continue advancing on that route through [supportive policies and incentives](https://energytracker.asia/publications/).In 2024, the country [issued](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnam-draft-decree-on-rooftop-solar-power-new-opportunities-on-the-horizon-for-investors.html/) policy guidelines for the rooftop solar market to stimulate self-produced and self-consumed solar energy in a bid to create favourable conditions and attract foreign investors to Vietnam’s renewable sector. According to the [IEA](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf), based on today’s deployment plans, Vietnam will remain Southeast Asia’s largest renewable power market by a wide margin. The country’s efforts to equip [half](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/18f3ed24-4b26-4c83-a3d2-8a1be51c8cc8/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf) of the office buildings and homes with rooftop solar panels will prove crucial for this development.\\\\n\\\\nLike Vietnam, the Philippines has also initiated [strategic policies and regulations](https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2024/10/Report-ASEANs-clean-power-pathways-2024.pdf) to boost rooftop solar power deployment.\\\\n\\\\nMalaysia’s government also plans to make the country a key player in the global green technology supply chain. It has already claimed a spot among the [world’s leading](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) solar PV manufacturers after China, Vietnam and Thailand.\\\\n\\\\n### **3. EVs and Batteries**\\\\n\\\\nIn October 2024, China’s share of the global electric car market rose spectacularly to [76%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/03/chinas-share-of-global-electric-car-market-rises-to-76). After seeing its green vehicle sales jump 40% domestically while exports soared 20% in 2024, China will continue leading the global EV transition in 2025 as well. While exports are likely to [slow down](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-car-sales-extend-gains-dec-2025-01-09/) this year, [IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2024 report](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024) sees the country responsible for over 50% of EV sales globally – a target China initially set for [2035](https://reglobal.org/china-could-surpass-a-50-ev-sales-share-by-2025-iea/). Other [analysts](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/12/23/ev-sales-outlook-2025-china-growth-analysts/) expect China to have an even greater share in global electric vehicle sales this year.\\\\n\\\\nOther Asian markets, such as Vietnam and Thailand, also promise to make strides in EV manufacturing. The former is already manufacturing [EVs](https://kpmg.com/vn/en/home/insights/2024/07/the-ev-landscape-in-vietnam.html) domestically, while in 2024, for example, China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, opened its first [EV factory](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-byd-opens-ev-factory-thailand-first-southeast-asia-2024-07-04/) in Southeast Asia in Thailand.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding battery technology, China will continue to lead the world in the upcoming years. As per the [IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/outlook-for-battery-and-energy-demand), its total committed battery manufacturing capacity will remain two times greater than its domestic demand by 2030, opening opportunities for exports. Aside from manufacturing, the country will advance [global battery recycling capacity](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/outlook-for-battery-and-energy-demand), 80% of which occurred in China in 2023. For reference, Europe and the United States are responsible for under 2% each. By 2030, global recycling capacity could exceed 1,500 GWh, of which 70% could be from China.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam plans to capitalise on the fact that it holds the world’s [second-largest](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) rare earth resources by increasing domestic production and becoming a key cog in the global critical minerals supply chain.\\\\n\\\\nTogether with Vietnam and Indonesia, Malaysia will be responsible for around [1%](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) of the committed battery manufacturing capacity globally in 2030. In 2024, it announced plans to build the [region’s largest](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/09/11/lahad-datu039s-energy-storage-system-to-be-region039s-largest) battery energy storage system project.\\\\n\\\\nThailand is already home to Southeast Asia’s [first lithium-ion battery gigafactory](https://www.nationthailand.com/business/corporate/40037092).\\\\n\\\\nThe Philippines is building [the world’s largest solar and battery storage power plant](https://www.energy-storage.news/philippines-president-breaks-ground-at-worlds-largest-solar-and-battery-storage-power-plant/). Currently, alongside Indonesia, it forms the world’s top nickel producers, accounting for about [65%](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) of global mined production. Under the new leadership, Indonesia also aims to continue marching toward becoming a nickel mining centre for [EV batteries](https://energytracker.asia/indonesias-energy-policy-under-the-new-president-prabowo-subianto/).\\\\n\\\\n### **4. Green Hydrogen**\\\\n\\\\nIn the past two years, reputable analysis desks from [BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/), [Citibank](https://www.citifirst.com.hk/home/upload/citi_research/rsch_pdf_30174354.pdf) and [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/ce/en/events/SkillSphere/reality-check-global-hydrogen-economy-edition-2.html) have all issued reports calling the clean hydrogen market situation a “reality check”.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [BNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/), while a supportive policy environment and a maturing project pipeline will make clean H 2 supply skyrocket 30-fold to 16.4 million tonnes per year by 2030, it won’t meet most government targets. Furthermore, the experts expect just a third of the 1,600 projects announced to date to materialise and often later than planned. Of these, half would be green hydrogen.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAsia Pacific Hydrogen Demand by Sector and Country (in MtH2). Source: [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/assets-zone1/apac/en/docs/collections/2024/clean-hydrogen-in-asia-pacific.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nIn a nutshell, there are just a handful of markets where the technology is proving economically feasible. According to a Wood Mackenzie [analysis](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/), in 2025, these would be regions that leverage cheap solar and wind power and benefit from government incentives that reduce costs and ensure financial viability. Cases in point are China and India.The experts note that the ability to ensure competitive pricing, shorter delivery times and strong manufacturing capacity will prove huge competitive advantages for Chinese electrolysers, which will capture a third of the global market outside the EU and North America. China plans to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity, including adding over 10 GW of capacity this year.\\\\n\\\\nYet, Wood Mackenzie’s [analysis](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/) notes that the lack of transparency regarding offtake contracts across China makes assessing the full extent of uncontracted volumes in the country difficult. The uncertainty is also highlighted by [BNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 11: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nMarket Penetration of Chinese Equipment Outside the EU and North America Will Exceed One-third by the End of 2025. Source: [Wood Mackenzie](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/)\\\\n\\\\nSoutheast Asia will also mark progress in green hydrogen, mainly due to benefitting from low-cost renewable energy and [affordable electrolysers](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/) from Chinese manufacturers. According to [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/south-east-asia-hydrogen-generation-market), Indonesia will emerge as the region’s leading green hydrogen production market in the years up to 2030.\\\\n\\\\nS&P Global [expects](https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/energy-transition/121124-commodities-2025-asia-pacifics-low-carbon-hydrogen-tenders-to-test-readiness-for-clean-fuel-trades) Japan and South Korea to be very active on the green hydrogen front, although it sees Asia’s pipeline experiencing major project cancellations and readjustments to original strategies in 2025. However, policy fragmentation and high production costs are expected to remain [significant hurdles](https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/01/04/regional-partnerships-can-power-a-resilient-asia-pacific-hydrogen-ecosystem/).\\\\n\\\\n**Asia To Continue Attracting Investors With Private Capital While Initiatives Play a Crucial Role**\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2023) finds that investments in Asia’s clean electricity sector significantly outweigh those in fossil fuels, and the growth of coal power is declining. However, a more in-depth view reveals that Asia’s investment landscape is one of extremes. China has established itself as the [undisputed global leader](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-investment-in-clean-energy-by-selected-country-and-region-2019-and-2024) in clean energy investment growth between 2019 and 2024, while India ranks fourth after the US and the EU. Southeast Asia’s spending on clean energy makes up only about [2%](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/southeast-asia) of the global total.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay on track with the Paris Agreement, BloombergNEF estimates that Asia-Pacific countries would need[USD 88.7 trillion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/asia-pacific-needs-greater-public-private-commitment-and-us88-7-trillion-in-investments-to-stay-on-track-for-paris-agreement/) in investments. This is the total capital needed from all stakeholders, including companies, financial institutions, governments and consumers. Furthermore, the figures are just 20% higher compared to an Economic Transition Scenario (BNEF’s base case scenario), and the falling costs of low-carbon solutions, such as EVs and clean power, and new policy commitments will help close the spending gap between the two scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 13: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAsia Pacific Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario. Source: [BloombergNEF](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Asia-Pacifics-energy-transition-outlook_FINAL.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the experts estimate that clean energy investments in the region will have to increase significantly in the coming years. For example, the investments in the period between 2024 and 2030 should be triple the 2023 levels to align with the Paris Agreement’s goals.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 15: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nEnergy Transition Investment in Asia Pacific – 2023 Estimate Versus Required Annualized Levels Across 2024-2050, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario. Source: [BloombergNEF](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Asia-Pacifics-energy-transition-outlook_FINAL.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nRegarding regional differences, China will represent 55% of the investments between 2024 and 2050, while in a net-zero-aligned scenario, India would represent an investment opportunity of USD 12.4 trillion.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 17: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nCumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario. Source: [BloombergNEF](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Asia-Pacifics-energy-transition-outlook_FINAL.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, investors are looking favourably toward Asia. According to [KPMG](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/sg/pdf/2024/11/energy-transition-investment-outlook-2025-and-beyond.pdf), the recent progress on the regulatory front has helped create a more welcoming investment environment and established East Asia as the most preferred region for energy transition investors over the past two years. The consultancy finds that 2025 will be no different. While KPMG advises investors to move early into emerging markets to gain rewards, Asian governments must continue improving their regulatory frameworks to convince private capital holders that their markets are quickly maturing and capable of limiting investment risks. Governmental intervention and introduction of policies, such as feed-in tariffs, regulatory support, tax incentives, direct investments, subsidies and research and development grants are deemed most important for driving investments into energy transition technologies in APAC going forward.\\\\n\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n[#### by Viktor Tachev](https://energytracker.asia/renewable-energy-trends-in-asia/#Viktor-Tachev)\\\\nViktor has years of experience in financial markets and energy finance, working as a marketing consultant and content creator for leading institutions, NGOs, and tech startups.

Updated quantitative data reveal that Sweden’s share of renewable energy increased from 53.4% to 66% between 2017 and 2022, still far outpacing France, who grew from 15.8% to 20.3% (Eurostat, n.d.). While Sweden is the top European Union performer by a wide margin, France finds itself struggling. Coming in as the 15th ranked EU country when measured in share of renewable energy, France is some 3% below the EU average. They are also just one of four countries to miss their 2020 renewable energies target in 2022 (\\\\\"Renewable Energy in the European Union,\\\\\" n.d.). Sweden’s success stems from long-term policy consistency, high carbon taxes, and effective market-based mechanisms like the green certificate system (International Energy Agency, 2021; Andersson, 2019; Swedish Energy Agency, 2020). Meanwhile, France’s reliance on nuclear energy and complex permitting processes has slowed renewable energy adoption (Bergek & Berggren, 2014; World Bank Group, 2020).\\\\nIntroduction The global transition to renewable energy is a critical strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting sustainable economic growth (IPCC, 2022). Renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and bioenergy, are essential in lowering carbon footprints and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels (Jacobson et al., 2019). Within the Brown 3 European Union (EU), member states are bound by comprehensive regulatory frameworks and incentive programs, such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the European Green Deal, designed to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and achieve the EU’s ambitious climate goals (European Commission, 2023a, 2019). These policies offer financial incentives, promote infrastructure investment, and support market-based mechanisms like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), encouraging the transition towards a greener energy future (European Commission, 2023b; Ellerman & Buchner, 2007).\\\\nDespite these common EU-wide frameworks, there are significant disparities in how member states adopt renewable energy. France and Sweden, two countries on opposite ends of the renewable energy usage spectrum in the European Union, exemplify this divergence. These disparities highlight how national-level policy execution, regulatory efficiency, and historical energy reliance shape renewable energy adoption (Bergek & Berggren, 2014; World Bank Group, 2020).\\\\nThe objective of this research is to examine the factors contributing to Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption compared to France’s slower progress, despite both countries having access to the same EU-wide incentive programs. The study aims to analyze the domestic policy decisions, market structures, and societal attitudes that have allowed Sweden to lead in renewable energy adoption while France faces regulatory and policy barriers that have slowed its transition (Andersson, 2019; International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nThis research combines quantitative metrics, such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and renewable energy growth, with qualitative analysis of policy frameworks and cultural factors. Findings highlight Sweden’s significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions Brown 4 (from 1.0 to 0.6 tonnes per capita)(Eurostat, n.d.) and transport sector emissions (148.2 to 66.6 g/km) (Eurostat, n.d.). In contrast, France’s slower progress (6.8 to 5.7 tonnes per capita and 133.8 to 103.1 g/km) underscores regulatory inefficiencies and limited policy alignment. The results emphasize that Sweden’s cohesive domestic policies offer a replicable model for France and other EU countries seeking to enhance renewable energy adoption and meet carbon neutrality goals.\\\\nThe central research question guiding this study is: How has Sweden’s domestic policy execution resulted in more effective renewable energy adoption compared to France, despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide frameworks? The hypothesis is that Sweden’s long-term commitment to stable renewable energy policies, high carbon taxes, and community-driven projects has facilitated its success, while France’s historical dependence on nuclear power, policy fragmentation, and regulatory complexities have slowed its progress (Andersson, 2019; International Energy Agency, 2021). This research will provide insights into the critical role of national policy execution in achieving EU-wide renewable energy goals, offering valuable lessons for other EU countries aiming to enhance their renewable energy strategies.\\\\nBrown 5 Figure 1: Share of Renewable Energy in Gross Final Energy Consumption (2017–2022) Literature Review Government policies play a crucial role in shaping the adoption of renewable energy across European Union (EU) member states (European Parliamentary Research Service, 2016).\\\\nSeveral studies have demonstrated how national-level policy frameworks, financial incentives, and regulatory processes can either facilitate or hinder the transition to renewable energy (European Commission, 2020). The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the European Green Deal provide overarching incentives for all member states to adopt renewable energy technologies (European Commission, 2023). However, the degree of success varies significantly between countries due to differences in how these EU-wide policies are implemented at the national level (European Commission, 2020). Research has consistently shown that stable, well-coordinated national policies are key drivers of renewable energy growth, while fragmented policies and complex regulatory environments tend to slow progress (European Parliamentary Brown 6 Research Service, 2016). Recent figures from the European Union highlight the role of financial mechanisms, such as green bonds, in accelerating renewable energy investments (European Commission, 2023). Sweden’s higher allocation to green bonds (16.2% in 2022) demonstrates the importance of financing strategies in enabling transitions, while France’s lower share (5.9%) reflects an area for growth (Eurostat, n.d.). Similarly, circular economy principles—more pronounced in France—can complement renewable energy strategies by ensuring material efficiency in infrastructure deployment (European Commission, 2023).\\\\nFigure 2: Allocation of Green Bonds as a Share of Total Issuance (2022) Brown 7 Sweden’s Success Factors Sweden is frequently cited as a leader in renewable energy adoption, driven by several key policy initiatives (International Energy Agency, 2019). Its high carbon tax, among the highest globally, has been instrumental in making fossil fuels economically unattractive, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1.0 tonnes per capita in 2017 to 0.6 tonnes in 2022 (Eurostat, n.d.).\\\\nFigure 3: Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2017–2022) The country’s commitment to energy efficiency is evident in the reduction of primary energy consumption per person, which decreased from 4.6 to 4.1 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) per capita—a standard unit of energy that represents the energy content of one tonne of crude oil—during this period (Eurostat, n.d.). Household energy use also saw a decline from 765 to 673 kgoe per capita (Eurostat, n.d.) during this period. These reductions underscore the effectiveness of cohesive, long-term policies (Government Offices of Sweden, 2021).\\\\nBrown 8 Figure 4: Key Household Energy Efficiency Metrics In addition to the carbon tax, Sweden’s green certificate system, implemented in 2003, has been identified as a critical success factor (Sweden.se, 2023). This market-based mechanism incentivizes the production of renewable electricity by requiring utilities to purchase green certificates to meet renewable energy quotas (CMS Law, 2023). Research shows that the predictability and consistency of this system have provided long-term confidence for investors, leading to significant growth in renewable energy infrastructure (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).\\\\nCommunity engagement is another factor contributing to Sweden’s success (Lund University, 2021). Studies reveal that community ownership of renewable energy projects, particularly in wind energy, has increased public acceptance and participation (Institute for Human Rights and Business, 2022). Community-driven initiatives not only spread the financial benefits of renewable energy projects more equitably but also reduce opposition to new projects, which is often a major barrier in other countries (Lund University, 2021).\\\\nFrance’s Barriers In contrast, France’s progress in renewable energy adoption has been slower, despite operating under the same EU-wide incentive structures (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nFrance has a historical reliance on nuclear power, which supplies over 70% of the country’s Brown 9 electricity (AXA XL, 2023). This points to reduced urgency for renewable energy investments.\\\\nWhile nuclear energy helps France meet its low-carbon goals, it has delayed the diversification of the country’s energy mix (International Energy Agency, 2021). This dependence on nuclear power has created a policy environment less focused on expanding renewables like wind and solar (France 24, 2024).\\\\nFigure 5: Renewable Energy vs Nuclear Energy Share by Country Moreover, France’s regulatory complexities have been a significant obstacle (IDDRI, 2022). Its slower progress is reflected in modest renewable energy growth, increasing from 15.8% to 20.3% between 2017 and 2022. While Sweden reduced transport CO2 emissions to 66.6 g/km, France’s decline to 103.1 g/km highlights its comparatively slower adoption of low-carbon transport technologies.\\\\nBrown 10 Gaps in Existing Literature While previous research has extensively covered the influence of national policies on renewable energy adoption within individual EU countries, there is a gap in the literature concerning direct comparative analyses between countries like Sweden and France, which operate under similar EU-wide incentives but have vastly different outcomes. Few studies have systematically examined the reasons behind Sweden’s superior performance in renewable energy adoption compared to France’s slower progress, considering the impact of domestic policy execution, regulatory frameworks, and cultural factors. This research addresses this gap by providing a detailed comparative analysis of the renewable energy strategies in Sweden and France, focusing on how domestic policies influence the effectiveness of EU-wide incentive programs. By exploring these differences, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of how national contexts shape the success of renewable energy adoption under EU frameworks.\\\\nMethodology This research employs a comparative analysis of renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden, using a mixed-methods approach that integrates both quantitative and qualitative data. Given the limitations of being an undergraduate study with restricted funding, this research primarily relies on secondary data sources, including government reports, EU databases, academic literature, and case studies. The analysis is designed to understand the effectiveness of domestic policies in implementing EU-wide renewable energy incentive programs and to assess the broader contextual factors that influence renewable energy adoption in both countries.\\\\nBrown 11 Research Design As stated previously, this study follows a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative policy reviews. Quantitative data is used to measure the key metrics of renewable energy adoption, while qualitative analysis provides insights into the domestic policies, regulatory frameworks, and cultural factors that have shaped the renewable energy landscapes in France and Sweden. The comparative analysis framework allows for a systematic evaluation of how different domestic approaches, despite common EU policies, have resulted in divergent outcomes in renewable energy adoption.\\\\nData Collection Data for this research is sourced from a variety of secondary resources, including: ● Government Reports: Official energy reports from both France and Sweden, as well as EU-wide policy documents, provide information on renewable energy targets, policy initiatives, and the implementation of incentive programs.\\\\n● EU Databases: Data from Eurostat and other EU-level databases are used to track renewable energy adoption rates, carbon emission reductions, and financial investments in renewable infrastructure in both countries.\\\\n● Academic Papers: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed academic studies on renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden is conducted to understand the academic perspective on national policies and their effectiveness.\\\\nBrown 12 ● Case Studies: Existing case studies of renewable energy projects, as well as first-person perspective on multiple SMEs gained throughout the semester.\\\\nQuantitative Metrics The quantitative analysis focuses on several key metrics that allow for a direct comparison of renewable energy adoption between France and Sweden: ● Renewable Energy Adoption Rates: Percentage of energy derived from renewable sources.\\\\n● Energy Consumption: Primary and final energy consumption per capita, providing insights into energy efficiency improvements.\\\\n● Energy Productivity: Growth in economic output (EUR/kgoe) relative to energy use.\\\\n○ kgoe (kilogram of oil equivalent): A standard unit of energy that allows comparison between different types of energy sources (e.g., electricity, natural gas, coal). One kgoe equals approximately: ■ 41.868 megajoules (MJ) ■ 11.63 kilowatt-hours (kWh) ● Carbon Emissions Reductions: Changes in greenhouse gas emissions per capita and transport emissions (g CO2 per km).\\\\n● Social Energy Accessibility: Population unable to keep homes adequately warm, reflecting affordability and inclusivity of energy transitions.\\\\nBrown 13 ● Green Financing: Share of green bonds in total issuance, measuring financial mechanisms supporting renewable energy investments.\\\\nThe quantitative metrics of both countries were analyzed through comparison of publicly available Eurostat metrics to evaluate how well each country has utilized EU-wide incentive programs, as well as to determine the financial and environmental impacts of renewable energy adoption in both contexts.\\\\nQualitative Analysis The qualitative analysis focuses on policy reviews and broader contextual factors that have influenced the success or challenges of renewable energy adoption in each country. Key areas of qualitative analysis include: ● Policy Reviews: A detailed examination of Sweden’s and France’s renewable energy policies, including the implementation of EU-wide directives, domestic incentives like Sweden’s green certificate system (Swedish Business School, 2005), and regulatory challenges in France’s wind energy sector.\\\\n● Public Engagement: Analysis of community involvement in renewable energy projects, particularly in Sweden, where community ownership models have been a driving force behind the success of wind energy projects (Energy, Sustainability and Society, 2023). The research explores the extent to which public acceptance and local involvement have played a role in renewable energy adoption.\\\\nBrown 14 ● Regulatory Frameworks: A review of the regulatory processes in both countries, with a focus on the differences in permitting processes for renewable energy projects, which have been a major barrier in France but more streamlined in Sweden (Tethys, 2021).\\\\nResults The comparative analysis of France and Sweden’s renewable energy adoption reveals significant differences in their progress despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide incentive structures. Quantitative data from the EU and national sources, combined with qualitative policy analysis, highlight the contrasting outcomes in renewable energy growth, financial impacts, and overall policy effectiveness in each country.\\\\nComparative Data on Renewable Energy Growth Sweden’s renewable energy adoption demonstrates remarkable growth underpinned by strong policy frameworks. Between 2017 and 2022: ● As previously mentioned, Sweden’s share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption grew from 53.4% to 66%, an increase of 12.6 percentage points, largely driven by bioenergy, hydropower, and wind (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022).\\\\n● France’s renewable share increased modestly from 15.8% to 20.3%, reflecting only a 4.5 percentage point increase, hindered by Brown 15 its reliance on nuclear power and slow development of wind energy projects (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nFigure 6: Renewable Energy Growth by Country (2017 v. 2022) Emissions Reductions Sweden achieved significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions: ● Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions (per capita): Fell from 1.0 tonnes in 2017 to 0.6 tonnes in 2022, highlighting the impact of high carbon taxes and renewable energy growth (Statistics Sweden, 2023).\\\\n● Transport Emissions (CO2 per km): Dropped sharply from 148.2 g/km to 66.6 g/km, showcasing the effectiveness of Sweden’s policies in promoting electric vehicles and low-carbon technologies (Statista, 2024).\\\\nFrance saw slower reductions: ● Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions (per capita): Fell from 6.8 tonnes to 5.7 tonnes, reflecting its slower renewable energy adoption.\\\\nBrown 16 ● Transport Emissions (CO2 per km): Declined from 133.8 g/km to 103.1 g/km, showing moderate progress compared to Sweden.\\\\nFigure 7: Emission Metrics by Country (2017 v. 2022) Energy Efficiency and Accessibility Sweden’s energy consumption improvements: ● Primary Energy Consumption (toe per capita): Reduced from 4.6 to 4.1, reflecting better energy efficiency measures.\\\\n● Final Household Energy Consumption (kgoe per capita): Decreased from 765 to 673, highlighting Sweden’s success in residential energy efficiency.\\\\nFrance’s reductions were also notable but slower: ● Primary Energy Consumption (toe per capita): Declined from 3.6 to 3.0, showing steady but less dramatic improvements.\\\\n● Final Household Energy Consumption (kgoe per capita): Dropped from 620 to 547.\\\\nBrown 17 Sweden also faced a smaller increase in energy accessibility challenges, with the population unable to keep homes adequately warm rising from 2.1% to 3.3%. Again, in France, this figure more than doubled from 4.9% to 10.7%, highlighting possible affordability challenges.\\\\nFigure 8: Population Unable to Keep Homes Warm (% of Population, 2017–2022) Figure 9: Household Energy Metrics by Country (2017 v. 2022) While Sweden has maintained relatively low energy import dependency, increasing marginally from 26.7% to 26.8%, France’s reliance on energy imports has risen significantly from 48.7% to 51.9% (Eurostat, n.d.). This further illustrates Sweden’s Brown 18 self-sufficient energy model compared to France\\'s higher reliance on external energy sources.\\\\nA notable difference also appears in circular material use rates. France demonstrated progress, increasing from 18.7% to 19.3%, emphasizing material efficiency in domestic use. Conversely, Sweden\\'s rate declined from 6.7% to 6.1%, suggesting a need for improvement in material reuse within renewable infrastructure within Sweden, and pointing to an area of relative expertise that France could explore leveraging to increase their usage of renewable energy (Eurostat, n.d.).\\\\nSummary of Findings Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption is the result of a cohesive and consistent policy framework, including high carbon taxes, an effective green certificate system, and strong community engagement (Government Offices of Sweden, n.d.; Sweden.se, n.d.). These policies have enabled Sweden to surpass its renewable energy targets while maintaining a balanced approach to energy accessibility (International Energy Agency, 2021). France’s progress, in contrast, has been hindered by regulatory barriers, policy inconsistency, and its reliance on nuclear energy (International Energy Agency, 2021; France 24, 2024).\\\\nThe findings underscore the critical role of policy stability, energy diversity, and public engagement in driving renewable energy transitions (IDDRI, 2022). Sweden’s model offers valuable lessons for France and other EU countries seeking to enhance their renewable energy strategies.\\\\nBrown 19 Figure 10: Summary of Major Comparative Metrics Brown 20 Discussion Interpretation of Findings The findings reinforce the critical role of stable, long-term policy frameworks in driving renewable energy adoption: ● Sweden: Consistent growth in renewable energy (53.4% to 66%) and substantial emissions reductions (1.0 to 0.6 tonnes per capita) highlight the effectiveness of cohesive policies, including high carbon taxes, green certificates, and streamlined regulatory processes (CMS Law, n.d., Baker McKenzie, n.d.).\\\\n● France: Modest progress in renewables (15.8% to 20.3%) and slower emissions reductions underscore the challenges posed by fragmented policies, nuclear dependency, and bureaucratic delays. The French government has recognized these challenges and, in February 2023, adopted the Renewable Energy Acceleration Bill to address bureaucratic delays and streamline project development. The bill aims to cut red tape and expedite permitting procedures in specific \\'acceleration zones\\' to boost renewable energy production (Cleary Gottlieb, 2023).\\\\nPolicy Implications Possible methods for French acceleration in its renewable energy transition inspired by Sweden: Brown 21 1. Streamline Regulatory Processes: Simplify permitting for wind and solar projects to reduce delays and costs.\\\\n2. Expand Green Financing: Increase the issuance of green bonds, which accounted for 16.2% of total issuance in Sweden by 2022 but only 5.9% in France, to attract private investment.\\\\n3. Improve Energy Accessibility: Develop targeted subsidies or financial assistance programs to address the doubling of populations unable to keep homes warm.\\\\nWhile Sweden\\'s renewable strategy is widely applicable, France’s unique reliance on nuclear power requires solutions that integrate renewable energy with nuclear innovations to achieve progress without sacrificing energy security (International Energy Agency, 2021; Réseau de Transport d\\'Électricité, 2021; Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2024).\\\\nBroader Significance These disparities are not only national challenges but also impact the EU’s collective ability to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goals. Understanding the successes and barriers faced by Sweden and France is critical for designing reusable strategies applicable across member states.\\\\nFigure 11: EU Goal Progress by Country Brown 22 Sweden has maintained relatively low climate-related economic losses, increasing slightly from EUR 10.9 to 11.6 per inhabitant. In contrast, France saw a substantial rise from EUR 43.0 to 50.2 per inhabitant, indicating higher vulnerability to climate-related impacts (Eurostat, n.d.). Energy accessibility challenges are more pronounced in France, highlighting the impact of rising energy costs and social equity considerations in renewable transitions.\\\\nEconomically, the contribution of environmental goods and services to GDP has grown in both countries, with Sweden increasing from 3.5% to 4.1% and France from 2.6% to 3.0% (Eurostat, n.d.). This reflects the broader economic potential of transitioning to a green economy.\\\\nFigure 12: Environmental Value Added as % of GDP Brown 23 Cultural Factors Cultural and societal factors play a critical role in shaping the differences between Sweden and France’s renewable energy adoption rates (Wang, Wang, Yu, & Mao, 2023). In Sweden, a strong cultural emphasis on sustainability is deeply integrated into public policy and corporate behavior (Hjorth Warlenius & Nettelbladt, 2023). This alignment has fostered widespread acceptance and active participation in renewable energy projects. A notable example is the use of community ownership models in wind energy projects, which ensure that local residents share in the economic benefits (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020). These models, paired with participation in decision-making processes, have minimized opposition and created equitable distribution of financial gains, accelerating project approvals (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2016).\\\\nBrown 24 In contrast, France’s public attitudes toward renewable energy are more complex, influenced in part by the country’s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, which already provides a low-carbon alternative (International Energy Agency, 2021). While there is growing awareness of sustainability, wind energy projects in rural areas often face significant opposition. Concerns about visual impact, noise, and ecological disruption have led to delays and legal battles, slowing the adoption of renewables (Wretling, Balfors, & Mörtberg, 2022). Unlike Sweden, France has not fully embraced community ownership models or incentives that directly benefit local stakeholders (Leiren et al., 2020).\\\\nTo overcome these challenges, France could adopt strategies inspired by Sweden’s community-driven approach (Hjorth Warlenius & Nettelbladt, 2023). Implementing policies that encourage local ownership, such as profit-sharing mechanisms or co-ownership of wind farms, could help address opposition by providing tangible economic benefits to residents (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020). Additionally, fostering participatory planning processes that involve local communities in project design and decision-making could build trust and reduce resistance (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2016). These measures could create a stronger societal consensus around the need for a rapid energy transition, aligning public sentiment with France’s renewable energy goals.\\\\nLimitations As an undergraduate study with limited funding and resources, this research is subject to several limitations: ● Reliance on Secondary Sources: The analysis relies exclusively on publicly available secondary data sources, such as government reports and Brown 25 academic literature, as there is no primary data collection or direct contact with stakeholders. This limits the scope of the research to existing information, which may not capture the most up-to-date developments in renewable energy policies.\\\\n● Data Availability: In some cases, comprehensive data on specific metrics (such as recent investment levels) may not be equally available for both countries, leading to potential gaps in the analysis.\\\\n● Generalizability: The focus on France and Sweden means that the findings may not be directly applicable to other EU countries with different energy profiles or policy environments. However, the insights generated from this comparison can provide valuable lessons for other EU member states facing similar challenges.\\\\nDespite these limitations, this research aims to provide a complete comparative analysis of renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden, offering insights into how domestic policies and contextual factors influence the success of EU-wide renewable energy programs.\\\\nRecommendations From a higher level perspective, general recommendations can be made for France to accelerate its renewable energy adoption: 1. Simplify Regulatory Processes: Streamlining the permitting process for renewable energy projects, particularly in wind energy, would reduce delays and lower the costs associated with legal and bureaucratic Brown 26 challenges. Expanding the Renewable Energy Acceleration Bill and other policies like it would promote a more efficient regulatory system.\\\\n2. Adopt Long-Term, Stable Policies: France should work toward creating a more stable policy environment for renewable energy investors by reducing the frequency of policy changes and offering consistent financial incentives. This would encourage long-term investments in renewable infrastructure, similar to the confidence-building policies implemented in Sweden (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\n3. Increase the Carbon Tax: By raising the carbon tax and using the revenue to fund renewable energy projects, France could create stronger financial incentives for reducing fossil fuel consumption and investing in clean energy alternatives (International Energy Agency, 2021). Sweden’s high carbon tax has been a major driver of its renewable energy success, and a similar approach could benefit France (Government of Sweden, n.d.).\\\\n4. Foster Community-Driven Renewable Projects: France could enhance public acceptance and local support for renewable energy projects by fostering greater community involvement and ownership. Sweden’s community-based approach to wind energy projects has minimized local opposition and ensured that the benefits of renewable energy are shared more broadly across society (Walker & Devine-Wright, 2008).\\\\nConclusion Brown 27 This research has highlighted the significant disparity between Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption and France’s slower progress, despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide incentive frameworks, such as the Renewable Energy Directive and the European Green Deal. Sweden’s cohesive, stable policy framework, which includes a high carbon tax, the green certificate system, and robust community engagement, has facilitated the rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly in wind, bioenergy, and hydropower. In contrast, France’s progress has been slowed by policy fragmentation, regulatory complexity, and its reliance on nuclear power. Lengthy permitting processes and inconsistent policy have deterred investment and delayed the development of renewable infrastructure in France.\\\\nThese findings demonstrate that Sweden’s long-term policy consistency has been a key factor in its ability to meet and surpass its renewable energy targets, while France’s fragmented approach has created uncertainty and slowed its transition to a more diverse energy mix.\\\\nHowever, there are limitations in relation to the implementation of EU directives. As countries in the EU, such as France and Sweden, differ in a number of demographic categories, many frameworks that work for Sweden will likely require small to moderate modification to fit the infrastructure capacity of said country. Regardless, Sweden’s success in policy and their applications provide a roadmap for other EU countries hoping to follow in their footsteps.\\\\nBrown 28 References Andersson, J. J. (2019).

Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy sources represented 24.5% of the European Union’s final energy use in 2023. The share is estimated to have increased by one percentage point since 2022, still largely driven by strong growth in renewable electricity supply. The share is also amplified by a small 2023 reduction in non-renewable energy consumption. Meeting the new minimum EU target of 42.5% for 2030 will demand doubling the rates of renewables deployment seen over the past decade and a deeper transformation of the European energy system.\\\\n\\\\n### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#figure-1-progress-towards-renewable-energy-source-targets-for-eu-27)Figure 1. Progress towards renewable energy source targets for EU-27\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy sources (RES) have multiple **benefits** for society compared with fossil fuels, such as\\xa0mitigating climate change, reducing the emission of air pollutants and improving energy security. The revised\\xa0[Renewable Energy Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en)\\xa0increases the binding target from 32% to a minimum 42.5% share of renewables in EU energy consumption, with the aim of achieving 45%. Each Member State will contribute to this common target. Targets were not introduced for individual countries.\\\\n\\\\nAt 24.5% in 2023, the share of renewables in the EU increased by one percentage point from 2022. It represents a **historical high** following the adoption of important EU legal frameworks to speed up the clean energy transition. The [Fit-for-55 EU policy package](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en#:~:text=Under%20the%20European%20Climate%20Law,cost%2Deffective%20and%20competitive%20way.) and the higher EU ambitions introduced by the [RepowerEU plan](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en) are especially relevant in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\\\n\\\\nThe 2023 renewable energy share also signals a return to **higher\\xa0growth rates**\\xa0of renewables after a dip in 2021 (figure 1). In absolute values, the gross final consumption of renewables grew by almost seven million tonnes oil equivalent (Mtoe) between 2022 and 2023, driven by a substantial increase in solar power generation (by 19.7%) and wind power (by 9.3%).\\\\n\\\\n**Non-renewables** saw a reduction of 3%, mainly linked to lower utilisation of coal for energy supply. This increased the relative share of renewables in the EU gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe electricity system continued to lead decarbonisation efforts in 2023, with 45.3% of all EU power generated from renewable sources. It was followed by heating and cooling (26.2%) and transport (10.8%), where renewable energy from heat pumps (+13%) and renewable electricity consumption in road transport (+53%) increased notably, compared with 2022.\\\\n\\\\nSolid, gaseous and liquid biomass\\xa0resources together formed the **largest category** in 2023, totalling half of all renewable energy consumption. This may have implications for terrestrial carbon sinks, biodiversity and air pollution if the demand for biomass continues to increase. Solid biomass is most widely used in residential and district heating, electricity generation and industry. Gaseous biomass (biogas) is typically burned to produce heat and power, while liquid biomass fuels (biofuels) are mainly used directly or blended with gasoline and diesel in transport.\\\\n\\\\nWind (17%), hydro power (13%) and solar photovoltaics (9%) were the other three largest renewable energy sources, followed by heat pumps and liquid biofuels (both with an 8% share of all renewable energy use). Other renewables sources\\xa0were biogases, renewable waste, geothermal and solar thermal.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the **longer-term trends**, the RES share more than doubled between 2005 and 2023. This was driven by dedicated policies and support schemes, as well as increased economic competitiveness of renewables. The increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% over the last decade (or 5.0% since 2005).\\\\n\\\\nModelling from the\\xa0[IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023)\\xa0and\\xa0[Ember](https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/fit-for-the-future-not-fit-for-55/)\\xa0indicate that reaching the **new minimum target** for 2030 of a 42.5% share of renewables might be feasible if fast and decisive action is taken to promote renewables and reduce energy consumption. The trends in the deployment of solar photovoltaics and heat pumps also provides optimism. However, reaching the target will require a challenging CAGR of 8% on the EU renewables share until 2030, which is more than double the observed rate over the past decade. Considering this, the EU is not likely to meet its target, unless it allocates more resources for a deep transformation of the energy system.\\\\n\\\\n### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#figure-2-share-of-energy-from-renewable-sources-by-country)Figure 2. Share of energy from renewable sources, by country\\\\n\\\\nSweden, Finland and Denmark had the highest RES shares among Member States in 2023 due to strong hydro industries (Sweden and Finland), wind power and wide use of solid biofuels for district heating. By contrast, Luxembourg and Belgium reported the lowest deployment of renewables, of 12% and 15% in 2023.\\\\n\\\\nOver time, Denmark, Sweden and Estonia have experienced the highest growth in RES shares, with more than 20 percentage points increase since 2005. Croatia, Slovenia and Romania, on the contrary, have seen an increase of less than nine percentage points between 2005 and 2023.\\\\n\\\\nOn a shorter timescale, 22 EU Member States saw an increase in their renewable energy shares between 2022 and 2023. Austria, Bulgaria and Finland topped the list, having increased their RES share by three percentage points or more in 2023. In contrast, the RES share of Latvia, Slovakia, Luxembourg and Poland decreased, compared to 2022.\\\\n\\\\nIn the European Economic Area, Norway and Iceland both have RES shares above 75%. The two countries generate most of their electricity from hydropower while, in Iceland, geothermal energy provides the majority of heating.\\\\n\\\\n### Supporting information\\\\n\\\\nDefinition\\\\n\\\\nThis indicator measures the EU’s progress towards achieving its 2020 and 2030 renewable energy targets. Gross final renewable energy consumption is the amount of renewable energy consumed for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport in the 27 EU Member States, and is expressed as a share of gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe [Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC)](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en) defines gross final energy consumption as the energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to final consumers (industry, transport, households, services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries), including the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch for electricity and heat production, and including losses of electricity and heat in transmission and distribution.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1 shows consumption of energy from renewable sources (including only certified biofuels complying with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria) as a proportion of gross final energy consumption and the recently adopted 2030 target.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2 shows the consumption of energy from renewable sources as a proportion of gross final energy consumption by country. It illustrates the progress made by the EU and its Member States in the last year.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, please refer to the EEA\\'s\\xa0annual T[rends and projections in Europe,](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe) Eurostat’s page on [renewable energy statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Renewable_energy_statistics), and the Commission’s [Energy Union reports](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-strategy/energy-union_en) and [Climate Action Progress reports](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/progress-climate-action_en#climate-action-progress-report).\\\\n\\\\nMethodology\\\\n\\\\n**Eurostat data**\\\\n\\\\nThe renewable energy share data used for 2005-2023 were taken directly from the Eurostat SHARES tool. The SHARES tool focuses on the harmonised calculation of the share of energy consumption from renewable sources among the 27 EU Member States. This is done in accordance with the RED guidelines and is based on national energy data reported to Eurostat. The Shares tool detailed results and manual are available online: ([https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database/additional-data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database/additional-data)).\\\\n\\\\nElectricity generation from hydropower and wind power must be normalised to smooth the effect of weather-related variations. In the case of hydropower, the normalisation is based on the ratio of electricity generation to the installed capacity averaged over 15 years; in the case of wind power, a similar normalisation formula is applied over five years. The Shares tool takes into account all biofuels consumed in transport between 2005 and 2010, and only biofuels certified as being in compliance with the RED sustainability criteria for the years starting from 2011.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to the calculation of the gross final energy consumption for Cyprus and Malta, the derogation in RED was used. This derogation allows these countries to consider the amount of energy consumed in aviation, as a proportion of their gross final energy consumption, to be no more than 4.12%.\\\\n\\\\nThe discussion on individual renewable energy sources was based on Eurostat energy balances, since the SHARES tool focus on sectors, rather than individual sources. The comparison is made based on their primary energy supply.\\\\n\\\\n**Proxy data**\\\\n\\\\nValues for 2005-2023 are compiled by Eurostat and reported by Member States. An update of this indicator with EEA estimates for the previous year takes place every autumn.\\\\n\\\\n**Targets**\\\\n\\\\nThe 2030 target presented in this indicator was adopted in October 2023 and is defined as a share of renewable energy in the EU’s gross final energy consumption of 42.5% by 2030 with an additional “aspirational” 2.5% indicative top up that would allow to reach 45%.\\\\n\\\\nPolicy/environmental relevance\\\\n\\\\nThis indicator is a headline indicator for monitoring progress towards achieving the aims of the [Eighth Environment Action Programme (8th EAP)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/environment-action-programme-2030_en). It contributes mainly to monitoring progress towards sustainable energy aspects of Article 2.f of the 8th EAP which requires: ‘promoting environmental aspects of sustainability and significantly reducing key environmental and climate pressures related to the Union’s production and consumption, in particular in the areas of energy, industry, buildings and infrastructure, mobility, tourism, international trade and the food system’ . The European Commission Communication on the 8th\\xa0EAP monitoring framework specifies that this indicator should monitor the achievement by 2030 of the EU target of 42.5% renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe RED (2009/28/EC) and its recast directive RED II (2018/2001/EU) establish an overall policy for the production of energy from renewable sources and the promotion of its use in the EU. The RED III was adopted in 2023, introducing stronger measures and a new 2030 target for renewables, aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\\\\n\\\\nAchieving the 2030 target will depend on the fast implementation of the reinforced policy and legal framework in the Member States, especially via speeding up permitting procedures, better visibility of auctions for renewables and a better integration of the different sectors. Implementation needs to be accompanied by accelerated grid developments in order to absorb more renewables and the full implementation of a guarantee-of-origin system with energy purchase agreements to allow further development of the renewable consumer market. In addition, better and more integrated planning will be required to ensure not only a high efficiency of investment and an accelerated pace of development, but also that the market penetration of these renewable sources takes into account other policy objectives such as environment protection.\\\\n\\\\nThe share of renewable energy consumption in final energy consumption is a broad indicator of progress towards reducing the impact of energy consumption on the environment (i.e., through decreased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant emissions). At the same time, impacts of increasing renewable energy consumption on landscapes, habitats and ecosystems, namely from construction, the use of water, the use of fertilisers and pesticides for biomass and biofuel crops, and the extraction of heavy metals for photovoltaic cells must also be considered.\\\\n\\\\nReplacing fossil fuels with renewables results in lower carbon emissions. However, total carbon emissions are not necessarily determined by the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption, but by the total amount of energy consumed from fossil sources.\\\\n\\\\nAccuracy and uncertainties\\\\n\\\\n#### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#methodology-uncertainty)Methodology uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nOfficially reported renewable energy data were compiled by Eurostat using annual joint questionnaires, which are shared by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency, following a well-established and harmonised methodology. Methodological information on the annual joint questionnaires and data compilation can be found on\\xa0[Eurostat\\'s web page on metadata on energy statistics](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy).\\\\n\\\\nValues concerning the prevoius year, which normally are published by EEA during the autumn, are approximate (proxies) and have been estimated by the EEA. These proxies were not obtained following the formal collection process for official statistics and are therefore less accurate and reliable than official statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**Notes on uncertainties in the underlying statistics and methodology:**\\\\n\\\\nBiomass and bio-waste, as defined by Eurostat, cover organic, non-fossil material of biological origin, which may be used for heat production or electricity generation. They comprise wood and wood waste, biogas, municipal solid waste (MSW) and biofuels. MSW comprises biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes produced by different sectors. Non-biodegradable municipal and solid wastes are not considered renewable, but current data availability does not allow the non-biodegradable content of wastes to be identified separately, except in industry. Large data-gaps also exist regarding the [energy use of wood](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/environmental-sustainability-energy-generation-forest-biomass-2021-01-26_en), which further adds to the methodological uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nThe electricity produced from hydropower storage systems is not classified as a renewable source of energy in terms of electricity production, but is considered part of the gross electricity consumption of a country. Hydropower and wind power generation are calculated as actual generation and normalised generation. Normalised generation is calculated using the weighted average load factor over the last 15 years for hydropower and the last five years for wind power.\\\\n\\\\nThe indicator measures the consumption of energy from renewable sources relative to total energy consumption for a particular country. The share of renewable energy could increase even if actual energy consumption from renewable sources falls. Similarly, the share could fall despite an increase in energy consumption from renewable sources.\\\\n\\\\nElectricity consumption within a national territory includes imports of electricity from neighbouring countries. It excludes electricity produced nationally but exported abroad. In some countries, the contribution of electricity trade to total electricity consumption and the changes observed from year to year need to be looked at carefully when analysing trends in electricity from RESs. Impacts on the (national) environment are also affected, since emissions are taken into account for the country in which the electricity is produced, whereas consumption is taken into account for the country in which the electricity is consumed.\\\\n\\\\n#### Data sets uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nNo uncertainty has been specified.\\\\n\\\\n#### Rationale uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nNo uncertainty has been specified.\\\\n\\\\nData sources and providers\\\\n\\\\n*   [Share of energy from renewable sources \\\\\\\\[NRG\\\\\\\\_IND\\\\\\\\_REN\\\\\\\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_IND_REN/default/table?lang=en), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT)\\\\n    \\\\n*   [Approximated estimates for the share of gross final consumption of renewable energy sources in 2023 (EEA 2023 RES share proxies)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/1fd08152-1371-4274-8091-b50467738376), European Environment Agency (EEA)\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n### Metadata\\\\n\\\\nDPSIRResponseTopics\\\\n\\\\n[Energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Energy&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\n[Renewable energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Renewable%20energy&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\n[Climate change mitigation](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Climate%20change%20mitigation&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\nTags\\\\n\\\\n[renewable energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=renewable%20energy)\\\\n\\\\n[Energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=Energy)\\\\n\\\\n[8th EAP](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=8th%20EAP)\\\\n\\\\n[ENER028](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=ENER028)\\\\n\\\\nTemporal coverage\\\\n\\\\n2005-2030\\\\n\\\\nGeographic coverage\\\\n\\\\n*   Austria\\\\n*   Belgium\\\\n*   Bulgaria\\\\n*   Croatia\\\\n*   Cyprus\\\\n*   Czechia\\\\n*   Denmark\\\\n*   Estonia\\\\n*   Finland\\\\n*   France\\\\n*   Germany\\\\n*   Greece\\\\n*   Hungary\\\\n*   Iceland\\\\n*   Ireland\\\\n*   Italy\\\\n*   Latvia\\\\n*   Lithuania\\\\n*   Luxembourg\\\\n*   Malta\\\\n*   Netherlands\\\\n*   Norway\\\\n*   Poland\\\\n*   Portugal\\\\n*   Romania\\\\n*   Slovakia\\\\n*   Slovenia\\\\n*   Spain\\\\n*   Sweden\\\\n\\\\nTypologyPolicy-effectiveness indicator (Type D)UN SDGsSDG7: Affordable and clean energy, SDG13: Climate actionUnit of measure\\\\n\\\\nShare of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption (%);\\\\n\\\\nShare of energy from renewable sources (%)\\\\n\\\\nFrequency of disseminationOnce a year\\\\n\\\\n### References and footnotes\\\\n\\\\n1.

Renewable energy sector experienced record growth in power capacity in 2022 due to the newly installed PV systems, overall rise in electricity demand, government incentives and growing awareness of need to transition to clean energy sources.\\\\nThe solar PV market maintained its record-breaking streak, with new capacity installations totalling to approximately 191 GW in 2022 (IRENA, 2023). This was the largest annual capacity increase ever recorded and brought the cumulative global solar PV capacity to 1,133 GW. The solar PV market continued its steady growth despite disruptions across the solar value chain, mainly due to sharp increases in the costs of raw materials and shipping. In 2022, 114 ISA countries (members and signatories) represented approximately 489 GW (43%) of the global solar PV capacity. Europe & others region account for 56% of the total installed solar capacity among the ISA members followed by the Asia-Pacific (36%), Latin America & Caribbean and Africa regions contributing to approximately 7% and 1% respectively.\\\\nIn addition to the increase in solar capacity installations, 135 countries had included renewable energy components in their NDCs globally. The latest/revised renewable energy target in ISA Member countries are discussed in further sections of this report. The number of countries with renewable energy policies increased in 2022, continuing the multi-year trend seen in 2021 and 2020. Most countries support renewables with policy instruments that often vary depending on the technology, scale or other features of installation (e.g., centralised or decentralised).\\\\nInnovation and cost trends are being increasingly seen across a broad range of technologies. The emergence of new cell architectures has enabled higher efficiency levels. In particular, the most important market shift in cell architecture has resulted from bifacial cells and modules. Other technology improvements of solar such as solar trees, solar carports and floating solar are also discussed in this report. Solar PV cost trends emphasise on the major drivers for reduction in the cost of solar PV in 2023 and the decline in costs of solar PV module and other components. Major factors contributing to declining module costs included polysilicon availability and decline in the shipping costs and raw materials.\\\\nThe section on Solar Market Trends describes the ‘Distributed Renewables for Energy Access’ (DREA) systems, which are a key solution for fulfilling the modern energy needs and also improving the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people presently lacking access to electricity/clean cooking solutions. It specifically holds the key in cases where development of electric grid to deliver electricity up to the last mile is commercially not viable. Further, the report captures the market trends covering solar infrastructure and electricity access rates in ISA Member countries.\\\\nGlobal investment in renewables reached USD 0.5 Tn in 2022 due to the global rise in solar PV installations. Solar PV dominated investment in 2022, accounting for 64% of the renewable energy investment. The overall snapshot of the investment trends across Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe & others and Latin America & Caribbean regions are captured in the solar PV investment trends section of this report.\\\\nThis report is intended to educate the reader to understand the ongoing trends in the solar space across the world in terms of technology, policy, employment etc. and could bring out positive change in the lives of people and the planet.\\\\n1 Global trends in Solar Power 3 Introduction International Solar Alliance was launched on November 30, 2015 by India and France and ISA’s framework agreement came into force on December 7, 2017.\\\\nHeadquartered in India, the alliance of 114 countries works to address energy needs and challenges in Member Countries and scale up solar through multiple flagship interventions.\\\\nAs part of its Ease of Doing Solar (EoDS) initiative which provides data on renewable energy with a focus on solar for individual Member Countries, ISA also publishes the Global trends in Solar Power report which provides an overview of trends in the Solar Sector.\\\\nAbout International Solar Alliance (ISA) International Solar Alliance (ISA) aims to provide a dedicated platform for cooperation among solar-resource-rich countries, through which the global community (governments, bilateral/multilateral organizations, corporates, industry and the stakeholders) can contribute to help achieve the common goal of increasing the use and quality of solar energy. Further, ISA seeks to meet the energy needs of its prospective member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable manner.\\\\nISA has conceptualized the Ease of Doing Solar (“EoDS”) report for its member countries to capture and develop a holistic view of a country’s solar ecosystem. The Global trends in Solar Power report, as a part of the EoDS initiative, is envisaged to present key trends in the global solar market with a focus on ISA member countries. The objective of the report is to capture the best practices and trends in the area of policy, technology, market eco-system , supply chain and investment/ employment in the industry globally with a focus on ISA member countries.\\\\nTo avert the deleterious effects of climate change, the world is undergoing a major transition in the energy sector to achieve net-zero targets. Renewable energy occupies a central role in energy transition, and it is evident from the increasing trend of capacity additions, employments, and increasing solar energy investments. The major drivers for the increased penetration of solar deployment are described below, ▪Strong policy support for solar PV is driving the acceleration in capacity growth - Policy support remains a principal driver of solar PV deployment across the globe.\\\\n▪Solar PV is the major renewable technology of choice in the private sector - Companies investing in solar PV installations on their own premises are responsible for 30% of total installed PV capacity as of 2021.\\\\n▪Companies entering into corporate PPAs – signing direct contracts with solar PV operators for the purchase of generated electricity. Solar PV plants dominate renewables PPAs, with a share of almost 75% in 2020.\\\\n▪Net zero ambitions of corporate - Many corporates had set their ambition to be a net zero company. Getting to net zero requires tremendous, rapid change and large-scale technology deployment across industries.\\\\n2 Global trends in Solar Power 4 Glossary Global trends in Solar Power 5 Abbreviation Definition APV Agrophotovoltaic BoS Balance of System Bn Billion CAGR Compound Annual Growth Rate CMERI Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute CSIR Council of Scientific and Industrial Research CSP Concentrated Solar Power DREA Distributed Renewables for energy access EPC Engineering, procurement and construction EU European Union EV Electric Vehicle FIP Feed-in premium FIT Feed In Tariff GW Gigawatt GWh Gigawatt-hour Km Kilometre kWh Kilowatt-hour LCOE Levelized cost of electricity LNOB Leave no one behind Mn Million MU Million Units MVA Million Volt Ampere Abbreviation Definition MW Megawatt MWh Megawatt-hour MWp Megawatt peak NDC Nationally Determined Contribution OGS Off-Grid Solutions O&M Operation and Maintenance PLI Production-linked incentive PPA Power purchasing agreement PV Photovoltaic P2P Peer-to-peer RE Renewable Energy REC Renewable Energy Certificate RPS Renewable Portfolio Standards SDG Sustainable Development Goals SHS Solar Home Systems STEM Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Tn Trillion TWh Terawatt-hour UN United Nations USD United States Dollar Global Trends in Renewables & Solar 135 countries have notified net zero target, covering 88% of global emissions At the 2021 UN climate summit, countries agreed to a phase-down of unabated coal power 135 countries have notified renewable power targets, and 17 countries have solar specific targets 3,372 GW of global installed renewable power capacity in 2022 USD 0.5 Trillion in renewables and USD 308 Billion invested in solar in 2022 1,053 GW of global installed solar energy capacity in 2022 12.7 Million Worldwide employment in renewable energy in 2021 4.3 Million jobs in solar PV, caters one third of the total renewable energy workforce in 2021 Fossil fuel subsidies reached USD 532 Billion in 2021 Global trends in Solar Power 6 Source: REN 21, IEA, IRENA; 2022 Global Solar Overview 3 Global Solar Market A renewable-based economy is a game changer for a more secure, low-cost and sustainable energy future.\\\\nDevelopment of renewable energy is at the core of energy transition.

Facilitate permitting for utility-scale systems - Lengthy and complicated permitting processes are one of the major challenges to the faster deployment of utility-scale solar PV plants in many parts of the world, especially in Europe. Developing clear rules and pathways for developers applying for a construction permit, determining strict timeframes for application processing, and public engagement in the identification of land suitable for investment could significantly accelerate solar PV deployment.\\\\n2. Establish a balanced policy environment for distributed PV - Appropriate policies are needed to attract investment into distributed solar PV while also securing sufficient revenue to pay for fixed network assets and ensuring that the cost burden is allocated fairly among all consumers.\\\\nExisting policies /schemes Absence of policies/schemes Note: FIT - Feed-in Tariff; RPS - Renewable portfolio standards; REC - Renewable Energy Certificate; Source: REN21, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 22 A Renewable Policy Transition in China China has shifted its renewable energy pricing policy from a premium FIT model to a “grid parity” model where renewable and coal plants sell electricity at the same price. The National Energy Administration stopped approving FITs for renewable energy projects in 2018, which was followed by a decision to phase out FIT schemes. The move was driven by delay in FIT payments and by the plunging cost of PV modules.\\\\nThe policy transition resulted annual solar PV installations to fall approximately 30% in 2019. However, as prosumers sought to benefit from the final years of FIT, the market grew 60% in 2020, to reach 55 GW of new installations in 2021.\\\\nIn 2021, China announced its 14th Five-Year-Plan, puts a continued focus on wind and solar PV power as well as energy integration and energy storage, aiming for a 20% non-fossil fuel share in the energy mix by 2025. China’s recently announced targets for carbon neutrality by 2060 have also driven demand for renewables.\\\\nSource: REN21, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 23 Fossil Fuel Subsidies are back on the rise – Global Scenario According to IEA, energy subsidies have been rising since 2021 after a noticeable dip in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. In 2021, rebounding fossil fuel prices and energy had already lifted fossil fuel consumption subsidies to USD 532 billion, around 20% above 2019’s pre-pandemic levels.\\\\nAt a global level, Russia was the largest single provider of fossil fuel subsidy payments, followed by Iran and China in 2021. According to the IEA, subsidies for the use of fossil fuels increased to more than USD 1 Tn in 2022, by far the highest yearly value ever recorded.\\\\nIn 2022, the cost of fossil fuels experienced significant fluctuations and reached exceptionally high levels due to geopolitical tensions affecting energy markets. Various policy measures were implemented to shield consumers from skyrocketing prices. However, these interventions had an unintended consequence of maintaining the artificial competitiveness of fossil fuels compared to low-emission alternatives.\\\\nSource: IEA, 2022 Box 3 Box 2 ▪Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is a crucial element for successful clean energy transitions, as highlighted in the Glasgow Climate Pact.\\\\n▪Fossil fuel consumption is subsidized due to end-user prices being high enough to cover the market value of the fuel.\\\\n▪During an energy crisis, governments prioritize shielding consumers from price impacts rather than committing to phasing out subsidies.\\\\n▪This approach led to a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 2022 and the implementation of measures to mitigate the impact on energy bills.\\\\n▪While this provided temporary relief, it reduced the incentive for consumers to save or transition to cleaner energy sources, thus delaying a sustainable resolution of the crisis.\\\\n▪Moreover, these subsidies depleted public funds that could have been allocated to other areas, including clean energy transitions.\\\\n30,808 26,949 27,208 40,601 33,624 29,593 47,449 63,908 43,294 47,940 40,253 32,688 20,600 40,938 15,883 13,401 30,869 37,684 21,792 10,383 27,042 11,441 6,695 8,764 16,097 12,979 9,340 23,577 9,612 6,976 13,428 17,642 11,845 5,209 21,002 11,938 9,235 8,394 8,589 6,303 4,825 17,469 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 200000 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Million USD Fossil Fuel Subsidies in ISA Member Countries India Saudi Arabia Egypt Algeria Venezuela United Arab Emirates Source: IEA, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 24 Solar PV Technology Trends Taking advantage of the growing solar PV capacity across the globe, several countries are underway to stimulate future market growth, exploring innovative solar technologies from bifacial solar cells and floating solar farms to the energy harvesting trees. The major developments are as follows.\\\\nTechnologies Description Bifacial solar cells ▪Key features: Bifacial solar panels can generate up to 30% more energy than monofacial panels. Bifacial modules have also lower Balance of Systems (BOS) costs as fewer modules are needed to produce the same amount of energy as traditional modules.\\\\n▪Worldwide demand of bifacial modules has also raised, with countries such as the United States, Brazil and the United\\u2006Kingdom increasingly use these modules for utility scale Photovoltaic plants.\\\\n▪Based on the present market trend, bifacial solar modules are extending their geographical reach from Japan, Europe to the emerging markets across the globe. Bifacial solar modules have attracted a lot of market attention in the recent years.\\\\n▪The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) predicts that after having a minimal presence in 2017, the bifacial concept is expected to capture approximately 10% of the market share in 2018, increase to 15% by 2020, and potentially reach 40% within the next decade (IRENA, 2019).\\\\nSolar trees ▪In solar tree, the solar modules are planted on a single pillar, which resembles like a tree trunk. Solar tree serves the dual purpose of being an energy generator as well as an artwork.\\\\n▪Solar trees serve as a complementary option to rooftop solar, offering ergonomic advantages over traditional solar panels. They require around 100 times less space compared to horizontal solar plants while generating an equivalent amount of electricity.\\\\nThis makes solar trees a viable solution for economies facing challenges of limited land and space availability.\\\\n4.3 Global trends in Solar Power 25 The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI) residential colony in Durgapur is now home to the world\\'s largest solar tree, developed by CSIR-CMERI. With an installed capacity of 11.5 kW, this solar tree can generate an annual clean power output of approximately 12,000-14,000 units.\\\\nThe design of the solar tree ensures maximum sunlight exposure for each of its approximately 35 solar PV panels, minimizing shadow areas below. Unlike rooftop solar facilities, the solar tree\\'s arms holding the panels are flexible and adjustable according to specific needs, providing an additional advantage.\\\\nSource: CSIR-CMERI Website India develops World’s largest Solar Tree Box 4 Technology Description Solar carports ▪Solar carports are ground-mounted solar panels that are installed in the vehicle parking lots. Home driveways can also be laid underneath to form a carport.\\\\n▪Solar Carports are very popular alternative and supplement to the classic rooftop systems, with the benefit that the solar carports can be installed entirely independent of the roof angle, shape and orientation of the house.\\\\n▪Besides providing the shade to the vehicles parked underneath, they can efficiently generate electricity and offers a number of benefits. If solar carports are coupled with a well-designed charging system, the electricity produced can be used for EV charging thus reducing the costs of running the vehicle.\\\\n▪An elevated solar carport track the sun throughout the day, can generate 50-70% more energy than fixed solar carport systems of similar size and they are becoming a strong and attractive economic proposition in a growing number of markets.\\\\n▪Finally, space saving is another important aspect, as carports make better utilisation of land which is already in use for the vehicle parking rather than using an open land.\\\\nThe energy generation data from the solar tree can be monitored either real-time/ on daily basis. The Solar Tree can also have certain customizable features for application at diverse sites. The Solar Trees are designed in a manner to ensure minimum Shadow Area, thus potentially making it available for widespread usage in the agricultural activities such as, e-Tractors and e-Power Tillers and High Capacity Pumps.\\\\nSolar Trees can be aligned with Agriculture for substituting price-volatile fossil fuels. Each Solar Tree has the potential to save 10-12 tonnes of CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere as GHG when compared with fossil fuel fired energy generation.\\\\nBesides, the surplus generated power can be incorporated into the energy grid. This Agricultural Model can provide a constant economic return and support the farmers to counter the effects of the uncertain variation in agriculture related activities, thus creating farming an Economic & Energy Sustainable practice.\\\\nThe solar tree has the capability to include IOT based features, i.e. round-the-clock CCTV surveillance in agricultural fields, wind speed, rainfall prediction, real-time humidity, and soil analytics sensors.\\\\nSource: Ministry of Science and Technology (India),2016 Tata Motors and Tata Power inaugurate India’s largest Solar Carport at its Car Plant in Pune Tata Motors and Tata Power jointly inaugurated India’s largest grid-synchronized solar carport at the Tata Motors car plant in Chikhali, Pune. The 6.2 MW solar carport deployed by Tata Power will generate 86.4 lakh kWh of electricity per year and is estimated to decrease 7,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually and 1.6 lakh tonnes over its lifecycle.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 26 Box 5 Technology Description Floating solar farms/ floatovoltaics ▪Floatovoltaics refer to the photovoltaic solar power systems that float on dams, reservoirs and other water bodies.\\\\n▪These floating photovoltaic panels generate large amount of electricity, and the best part is, that they don’t use any space on real estate/ land.\\\\n▪Due to the cooling effect of water, these floating solar cells generate more power by up to 10%. However, floating solar PV also faces some challenges such as feasible site selection, rusting due to moisture and high cost as compared to conventional solar plants.\\\\n▪Besides producing electricity, these ‘floatovoltaics’ are also beneficial in water management by reducing water loss due to evaporation.\\\\nSpanning over to 30,000 square meters, the solar carport will not only generate green power, but will also provide covered parking for cars in the plant.\\\\nAlso, Tata Power Solar commissioned solar carport with 2.67 MW of capacity at Cochin International Airport. The project comprised of 8,472 solar panels on 27 carports spread over 20,289 square meter of area. Benefits: Offsets 1,868 tonnes of CO2 at Cochin International Airport per annum, equivalent to 46,700 tonnes of CO2 offset in 25 years. The plant generates 11,000 units of electricity daily.\\\\nSource: Tata Power Website Hybrid Hydropower and Floating Solar PV systems in China The development of the grid connected hybrid systems that combine floating solar photovoltaic and hydropower technologies is still at an early stage. Only a small system of 218 kWp has been deployed in Portugal.\\\\nIn 1989, the Longyangxia hydropower plant was commissioned with the four turbines of 320 MW each 1,280 MW in total. It serves as the frequency regulation and major load peaking power plant in China’s northwest power grid.\\\\nThe associated Gonghe solar plant is 30 kms away from the Longyangxia hydropower plant. The initial phase was built & commissioned in 2013 with a nameplate capacity of 320 MW.\\\\nAn additional 530 MWp was completed in 2015. The Photovoltaic plant is directly connected through a reserved 330 kV transmission line to the hydropower substation.\\\\nThe hybrid system is operated so that the energy generation of the hydro and Floating Solar Photovoltaic components complement each other. After the solar Photovoltaic was included, the grid operator began to issue a higher power dispatch set point during the day.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 27 Box 6 Technology Description Agrophotovoltaic (APV) As expected, on a typical day the output from the hydro facility is now decreased, especially from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., when solar Photovoltaic generation is high.\\\\nThe saved energy is requested by the operator to be utilised during the early morning and late night hours. Although the daily generation pattern of the hydropower has varied, the daily reservoir water balance could be maintained at the same level as before to meet the water requirements of the other downstream reservoirs.\\\\nAll power produced by the hybrid system is fully absorbed by the grid, without any reduction. This system shows that hydro turbines can provide adequate response to demand.\\\\nSource: World Bank, 2018 Global trends in Solar Power 28 Fiji Agrophotovoltaic Project in Ovalau In order to reduce Fiji’s reliance on hydropower, the electricity output is becoming increasingly volatile owing to irregular annual rainfall, this project aims to develop a 4 MW solar PV power generation system that will boost local agricultural production, and to combine it with a 5 MW battery storage system. The total project value is USD 10 million, including Green climate fund’s loan of USD 3.9 Mn and a USD 1.1 Mn grant.\\\\nSource: IRENA,2022 Box 7 ▪APV technology aligns with sustainable agriculture practices by utilizing land efficiently and promoting renewable energy generation in rural areas.\\\\n▪APV systems can help farmers diversify income streams by generating electricity and potentially accessing additional revenue streams through renewable energy incentives.\\\\n▪Research efforts are focused on understanding the agronomic impacts of APV systems, exploring compatible crop combinations, and assessing the long-term sustainability of this integrated approach.\\\\nThe \\\\\"Agrophotovoltaics – Resource-Efficient Land Use (APV-RESOLA)\\\\\" project, situated in Germany near Lake Constance, has successfully demonstrated the APV concept. The project involved a 194 kW solar system mounted on a 5-meter-high structure above land used for cultivating celery, clover, potatoes, and winter wheat. The findings confirmed earlier research, with land use efficiency reaching 160% in 2017 and 186% in 2018 (IRENA, 2019).\\\\nItaly included USD 1.24 Bn in support for agrovoltaics in its post-COVID recovery plan.\\\\nFarmers are beginning to gain wider awareness of the benefits of agricultural PV – including higher crop yields.\\\\nTechnology Description Solar energy storage Solar energy storage systems stores solar energy during the day to utilise at night/ during periods of low sunlight, reducing the need for grid electricity.\\\\nThere are several benefits of solar storage, including storing excess energy for use during periods of high demand, reducing reliance on the grid, and providing backup power in case of an outage.\\\\nBuilding-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) Building-integrated photovoltaics are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof, skylights, or facades. BIPV serves dual-purpose: they serve as both the outer layer of a structure and generate electricity for on-site use or export to the grid.\\\\nThe key benefits are : ▪ No unoccupied area required ▪ Decreased heat-transmittance ▪Decreased harmful irradiance Some of the constraints include: ▪ Higher capital cost for installation ▪ Difficult and expensive to retrofit older buildings ▪More complex and requires high labour charges than normal PV modules installation Global trends in Solar Power 29 Maryland, U.S - Solar and Battery Storage for Customer and Ancillary Services Solar Grid Storage LLC provided 500 kW AC storage comprising about 300 kWh of lithium-ion batteries and inverter combination to the headquarters of Konterra in Maryland. The storage and inverter system are connected to the solar PV panels with 400 kW capacity.\\\\nThe key objective of the Solar Grid Storage LLC is to provide both the customer and the grid with multiple benefits. This includes fast-power balancing support to the local grid, backup emergency power during grid outages and reduced system cost.\\\\nThe battery storage systems are connected to the local utility and can thus provide a range of ancillary services when required by the utility or grid operator through normal dispatch. Solar Grid Storage LLC’s standard service is to provide the inverter and storage system at a very low cost.\\\\nSolar Grid recovers these costs plus a profit margin through ancillary services provided to the grid and paid by the grid operator. Thus, Solar Grid Storage LLC business model effectively utilises solar battery storage to capitalise on the regulatory markets for ancillary services in the United States.\\\\nSource: IRENA, 2022 Box 8 Solar Supply Chain Trends This section focuses on the trends in the solar PV supply chain, bottlenecks and measures to build a more secure supply chain. For the solar PV technology, the main segments of the value chain include manufacturing of equipment, construction and installation, and O&M, plus a range of support services, enabling functions and governance aspects.\\\\nManufacturing Construction and Installation Operation and Maintenance Solar Supply Chain - Overview Source: IRENA, 2022 The solar PV manufacturing capacity shifted from Europe, the United States to China over the last decade. In 2022, China dominates the global solar PV supply chains. The global manufacturing capacity of solar PV jumped from approximately 25 GW (2010) to 220 GW (2022), with China accounting for 97% of the production. In addition, 300 GW of manufacturing capabilities have already been announced, underlying the willingness to prevent other actors from gaining significant shares of the market.\\\\nThe Chinese market dominance reflects the ability of local companies to gain benefit from the economies of scale, and the government support which has set strategic long-term goals in the industry.\\\\nBetween 2017 and 2021, around half of the total Chinese production of PV modules has been delivered to Asia-Pacific regions and India while the other half delivered to Europe, with smaller amounts directed to Latin America and Caribbean and the rest of the world.\\\\n4.4 Global trends in Solar Power 30 Key determinants of solar supply chain Raw material availability Manufacturing capacity and technology Market demand and growth Price and cost dynamics Innovation and research and development Trade policies and regulations The skewed geographical concentration in solar PV supply chain has led the European Union, India and the United States to introduce policy incentives to support domestic solar PV production. However, diversifying solar PV manufacturing will be possible only if the production costs reduce to ensure competitiveness with the lowest- cost producers (like China) in both short and long term.\\\\nChina has infrastructure and industrial policies that built an integrated supply chain with large economies of scale. Low labour cost is also a key enabler. China’s industrial policies focusing on solar PV have enabled economies of scale and enabled continuous innovation throughout the supply chain.\\\\nIn 2021, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia have become manufacturing and assembly hubs, together representing approximately 9% of cell and module production. Further Japan, India and Singapore account for 10.5% of cell and 7.6% of module production.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 31 78.20% 96.80% 88.60% 3.20% 0.50% 0.20% 18.30% 2.50% 2.80% 0.30% 0.20% 8.40% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2010 2021 2027 Wafers China Europe Asia-Pacific Rest of the World 28.60% 79.20% 89.20% 19.40% 8.00% 2.40% 21.50% 6.00% 2.00% 30.50% 6.80% 6.40% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2010 2021 2027 Polysilicon China Europe Asia-Pacific Rest of the World Source: IEA, 2022 55.70% 74.70% 73.90% 12.80% 2.80% 2.00% 18.70% 15.40% 10.70% 12.80% 7.10% 13.40% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2010 2021 2027 Modules China Europe Asia-Pacific Rest of the World 57.90% 85.10% 79.50% 7.30% 0.60% 0.70% 28.40% 12.40% 9.90% 6.40% 1.90% 9.90% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 2010 2021 2027 Cells China Europe Asia-Pacific Rest of the World Based on the IEA Data and Statistics (2022), the previous, and expected solar PV manufacturing capacity based on different technologies by region for the FY 2010, FY 2021 and 2027 provided below, ▪Manufacturing activities accounted for 1.6 Mn of the PV jobs; construction and installation accounted for almost 1 Mn jobs, with O&M accounting for 0.8 million jobs.\\\\n▪China’s dominant role in solar PV employment reflects its strong position as both the dominant manufacturer of equipment and its commanding position in capacity installations.\\\\n▪Supported by industrial policy measures, China is home to the bulk of the global PV supply chain. Approximately 72% of global polysilicon production takes place in China, with massive expansion of capacity under construction or planned.\\\\nKey Trends in Solar PV Manufacturing China India ▪The Indian government imposed import duties of 40% on all modules and 25% on all cells effective April 2022.\\\\n▪The country also introduced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency modules. This offers financial support for project developers who commit to setting up production facilities along the supply chain.\\\\n▪In 2021, the rising costs in China had knock-on effect on module prices.\\\\nIndian PV imports sank to a low of approximately USD 500 Mn, down from almost USD 4 Bn in 2018.\\\\nUSA ▪The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August 2022, embraces elements of a broader industrial policy.\\\\n▪It includes manufacturing credits for clean energy, in addition to a long-term extension of existing solar and wind tax credits and many other climate and health provisions.\\\\n▪A clean manufacturing tax credit alone could trigger approximately 1,15,000 job-years (direct, indirect and induced jobs), and tax credits for solar, wind and battery manufacturing could create another 5,61,000 jobs.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 32 In the past year, rising global commodity prices have led to higher material costs for solar PV manufacturing. Today, China and ASEAN countries (Viet Nam, Thailand and Malaysia) have the lowest solar PV module manufacturing costs for all segments of the supply chain. Economies of scale, supply chain integration, relatively low energy costs and labour productivity make China the most competitive solar module manufacturer worldwide. Higher investment costs in India are the primary reason for the cost differential with China, while higher overhead and labour costs makes US PV manufacturing not as competitive.\\\\nIn Europe, rising energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine widened the cost gap with China. Today, EU industrial energy prices are more than triple those of China, India and the United States.\\\\nThe solar PV manufacturing supply chain is influenced by factors such as land, energy, capital, and labor.\\\\nHowever, government industrial policies play a critical role in shaping viable supply chains. Polysilicon production requires significant capital investments and skilled labor. Solar cell manufacturing relies on access to modern production equipment and skilled machine operators. Module production, focused on assembly, requires less technical skill compared to cell fabrication.\\\\nDiversifying solar PV supply chains requires addressing key challenges - The cost competitiveness of existing solar PV manufacturing is a key challenge to diversify supply chains. China is the most cost-competitive country to manufacture components of the solar PV supply chain. Costs in China are 20% lower than in the United States, 10% lower than in India and 35% lower than in Europe. Large variations in labour, and investment explain these variations. In the absence of manufacturing support and financial incentives, the bankability of manufacturing projects remains limited outside China and few countries in Southeast Asia.\\\\nLow-cost electricity is a key enabler for the competitiveness of the solar PV supply chain. Electricity accounts for over 40% of production costs for polysilicon and 20% for ingots/wafers. Solar panel manufacturers can also use their own renewable electricity on site, thereby reducing both electricity bills and emissions.\\\\nGovernment policies are vital to build a more secure solar PV supply chain - High commodity prices and supply chain bottlenecks resulted in the increase of 20% in solar panel prices over the last year. Globally, policies to support solar PV have focused mostly on increasing demand and lowering costs.\\\\nHowever, sustainable and resilient supply chains are needed to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of solar panels. Governments need to turn their attention to ensuring the security of solar PV supplies as an integral part of clean energy transition.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 33 Solar PV Cost Trends One of the key trends in the solar PV industry in 2023 is the continued decline in the cost of components required for solar panel installations, such as solar cells and inverters. This is due to the increased manufacturing efficiency, advances in technology and economies of scale. Manufacturers have become more efficient in their solar PV production processes, leading to produce solar panels at a much faster pace. Advances in technology have led to manufacturing of solar cells and inverters at a lower cost. The economies of scale have resulted in the cost-effective production of solar panels in larger quantities. The figure below depicts the key drivers involved in reducing the price of solar panels, Technology improvements that have reduced system losses have played a vital role. The recent adoption towards an increased use of bifacial modules has increased the performance of the solar panel by generating more energy (than mono-facial panels).\\\\nFurther, solar PV module prices return to the downward curve they were following prior to the covid-19 pandemic, as polysilicon supply becomes more abundant. The raw material and shipping costs decline in 2023 also has a direct impact on solar component prices.\\\\nAdvances in technology 1 Manufacturing efficiency 2 Economies of scale 3 Global trends in Solar Power 34 Key factors influencing price of Solar PV Modules Source: IEA, 2020 Solar PV Module Price Trend Key factors influencing price of Solar PV Modules \\uf0a7 Technological advancements: The continuous improvement in solar cell efficiency, manufacturing processes, and material utilization has led to cost reductions and increased module output, resulting in lower prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Scale of production: As the solar industry expanded and production volumes increased, economies of scale kicked in. Larger manufacturing capacities allowed for bulk purchasing of raw materials and equipment, reducing production costs, and driving down module prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Policies and incentives: Various policies, such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and subsidies, have played a significant role in driving demand for solar PV installations. These incentives have stimulated market growth, increased competition, and ultimately led to price reductions.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Reduction in manufacturing costs: Over time, manufacturers have optimized production processes, improved yield rates, and reduced manufacturing costs. Factors such as automation, economies of scale, and increased competition among manufacturers have contributed to cost savings and subsequently lower module prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Supply and demand dynamics: Fluctuations in supply and demand have influenced module prices. Increased demand has strained the supply chain at times, resulting in temporary price spikes. Conversely, oversupply situations have led to price declines.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Raw material prices: The prices of key raw materials used in solar PV modules, such as silicon, silver, and aluminium, have experienced fluctuations. Changes in these material costs can impact module prices, although technological advancements and manufacturing efficiencies have helped mitigate the impact.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Trade policies and tariffs: Trade policies, including import duties and tariffs, have affected the price of solar PV modules. Imposition of tariffs on module imports has disrupted the supply chain and increased prices in some instances.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Balance of system costs: The components beyond the module itself, such as inverters, mounting structures, and installation costs, it has an indirect impact on module prices. As the balance of system costs decreased due to technological advancements and market competition, it created downward pressure on overall system prices, including modules.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Research and development (R&D) investments: Investments in solar PV research and development have driven technological advancements and innovation. R&D initiatives have led to the discovery of new materials, manufacturing techniques, and cell designs, all of which have contributed to price reductions over time.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Global market dynamics: Changes in the global solar PV market, including the emergence of new markets, regional variations in demand, and geopolitical factors, have influenced module prices. Market dynamics impact the balance of supply and demand, which in turn affects prices.\\\\nUSD 0.2 per Watt Solar Market Trends The rise of increasingly cost-effective energy storage combined with greater demand-side flexibility and the expansion of transmission infrastructure is making it possible for regions to transition to fully renewable-based power systems. Another factor enabling the transition to solar-based energy systems is the improvement in the electricity access rates, especially in the off-grid areas.

In Asia & Pacific, access to electricity reached 92.9% in 2020, Europe and others (100%), Latin America (96.4%).\\\\nIn Africa, access to electricity rates almost tripled from approximately 8 Mn between 2000 and 2013 to 24 Mn people between 2014 and 2019.\\\\nThe population without electricity access, peaked at 613 Mn in 2013, declined progressively to 572 Mn in 2019. Much of this transition came from countries such as Kenya, Senegal, Rwanda, Ghana and Ethiopia, while more than 40% of Sub-Saharan African countries do not yet have official electricity access targets.\\\\nMost of the gap in electricity access can be attributed to the countries where population growth has outpaced the electrification rate, such as Burundi, Chad, Malawi and Democratic republic of Congo. These countries should effectively utilise the natural solar potential to improve the electricity access rates.

Solutions range from small-scale off-grid installations for unelectrified rural clinics, to larger, steady power delivery services for urban clinics that house crucial medical devices but are subject to unreliable grids. During the pandemic, there has been a particular focus on cold chains to keep COVID-19 vaccines chilled from production to delivery. These cold storage facilities require a 24/7 power supply, which has come from hybrid solar/diesel, battery/inverter systems or direct-drive solar refrigerators.\\\\nDuring 2020 and 2021, a variety of initiatives included mini grids and microgrids in the health sector: • Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency developed several solar mini-grids for use at hospitals and other healthcare facilities as an emergency response to COVID-19. Health facilities also were a focus of several other donor-driven mini-grid initiatives.\\\\n• Power Africa, funded by the US Agency for International Development, directed USD 4.1 million in grants to off grid companies in 2020 to electrify health clinics in rural and peri-urban areas through mini-grids.\\\\nSource: REN21,2022 Box 9 Solar PV for Electricity Access - Chad At a global level, Chad has one of the lowest electricity access rates.

Solar Home Systems are decentralized and are particularly suitable for inaccessible and remote areas.\\\\nUnder the “Rural Electrification Program” of the Government of Bangladesh, about 3 Mn SHS have been installed in the last 16 years. Of these 3 Mn, around 1.5 Mn were installed by the Grameen Shakti since 1996.\\\\nGrameen Shakti focuses on the off-grid rural areas. Grameen Shakti is also promoting the small Solar Home System to target the low-income rural households.\\\\nSolar Home System can be used to light up shops, homes and fishing boats etc. It can also be used to charge cellular phones as well as to run radios, televisions, and cassette players. Solar Home Systems have become increasingly popular among users because they present an attractive alternative to conventional electricity.\\\\nAdvantages include no monthly bills, no fuel costs, very low repair and maintenance costs, easy installation anywhere, etc. Solar Home Systems installed by the Grameen Shakti has had a beneficial impact on rural households.\\\\nGrameen Shakti has introduced a micro utility model to reach the poorer people in rural areas who cannot afford SHS separately. More than 1.5 Mn SHS have been installed in Bangladesh through the microcredit system provided by the Grameen Shakti. Making it possible to charge mobile phones with SHS provides new access to more reliable telecommunication in off-grid areas.\\\\nAround 10 Mn people are getting benefits from the systems, and several tonnes of CO2 are abated each year as one Solar Home System saves 0.2 tonne of CO2/year from avoided kerosene use.\\\\nSource: International Network for Sustainable Energy Website 3. Solar Pumps In developing countries, most of the population depends on agriculture for living and the agricultural sector contributes a significant share of the GDP. Unavailability of water for irrigation due to dependence on rain and absence of affordable water pumps due to unavailability of electricity is a major challenge this sector is facing.\\\\nSolar Pump is one of the proven technologies that aim to increase the yield of agricultural lands by making water supply available in areas where the grid is not available.\\\\nBangladesh targets to deploy 50,000 solar pumps by 2025 and Morocco, 100,000 by 2022.

The majority of 43,000 salt pan farmers utilise inefficient diesel powered water pumps for extracting brine from ground as part of salt harvesting process. The diesel accounts for a significant proportion of farmers production costs. In fact, farmers spend up to 40% of their annual revenue buying diesel for the next production season, thus reducing disposable income.\\\\nTwo pilot projects, carried out by the Self Employed Women’s Association, have demonstrated that powering pumps with solar energy can decrease production costs, increase reliability, efficiency and salt harvest outputs, resulting in the improved rural livelihoods.\\\\nAnnual savings for a farmer rose to INR 83,000 - a 161% raise when compared to those using diesel-powered pumps with additional benefits including reduced air pollution. Across the Kutch, replacing diesel water pumps with solar and hybrid solar/diesel ones could potentially reduce CO2 emissions by 115,000 tonnes.\\\\nThe multi-functional nature of solar panels also increases its value, particularly for the off-grid villages, enabling complementary uses such as powering the households. Interestingly, some salt traders - who usually loan salt-pan-worker money to purchase diesel for irrigation, have now acquired the solar pumps and are leasing them out to salt pan workers on an annual basis.\\\\nIn this manner, they are able to recover their investment in three years, while making the technology accessible for salt pan workers who now need not incur the capital costs of the system.\\\\nSource: NRDC, 2018 Reducing Production Costs using Solar Pumps: India Global trends in Solar Power 41 Box 13 Source: IRENA, 2021 Solar PV Investment Trends The annual investments in renewable energy continued a positive trend in 2022.

The plan looks to mobilise EUR 225 Bn in loans from its existing Recovery and Resilience Facility, and an additional EUR 20 Bn in grants.\\\\nEurope attracted USD 54 Bn in 2019 and USD 67 Bn in 2020 (16% and 19% of the global total, respectively). As per IRENA, the investments reached USD 77 Bn in 2021, but dropped to USD 61 Bn in 2022. In 2020, investments in the region grew by 24% compared to 2019, driven primarily by an threefold increase in the Netherlands and a fourfold increase in investments in the United Kingdom.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 43 Africa Latin America and Caribbean African region remains the major destination for off-grid renewables investment - Between 2010-2021, the region attracted USD 2.2 Bn, more than 70% of global off-grid investments. Within Africa, the countries such as Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania and Rwanda attracted higher investments.\\\\nInvestment in these countries benefited from the existing mobile money ecosystem, which was leveraged by the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) business model. Approximately 78% of the total commitments in off-grid renewables between 2010-2021 involved the funding of projects using PAYGO, with East Africa accounting for USD 917 Mn.\\\\nAsia and Pacific Asia and Pacific region continues to attract the majority of global renewable energy investment of USD 170 Bn in 2020.\\\\nInvestment in renewable energy has grown significantly in Viet Nam, which overtook Japan to become the second-largest destination in 2020, largely due to expiring of FIT policy. From 2013 to 2020, investment grew by an average of 219% per year, rising from USD 47 Mn to USD 18.7 Bn. However, after the expiration of FIT, investments declined quickly from USD 18.7 Bn in 2020 to USD 9.7 Bn in 2021 to less than USD 4.7 Bn in 2022.\\\\nThe region attracted USD 137 Mn in off-grid renewable energy investments in 2019, led primarily by Myanmar.\\\\nDuring 2020-2021, investments plummeted to USD 3 Mn, likely due to the pandemic and political developments.\\\\nUnited States consistently attracted the majority of solar investments since 2013. In the United States, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act – encompassing new tax credits, USD 30 Bn in grants and loans for clean energy generation and storage, and USD 60 Bn in support of manufacturing of low-carbon components – is expected to attract USD 114 Bn investment by 2031.\\\\nLatin America and Caribbean region attracted 4.9% of global investments in 2020, followed by Asia and Africa.\\\\nDuring 2018-2021, Latin America and Caribbean attracted USD 21 Mn, equivalent to less than 1.5% of cumulative commitments over that period.\\\\nThe region has electricity access rates of more than 90%. With smaller shares of the population living in off-grid locations, these regions represent relatively small markets for decentralised energy systems.\\\\nInvestment Trends in Vietnam and Thailand Vietnam’s rapid industrialisation has prompted a surge in energy demand. Much of this industrial growth has been fuelled by foreign direct investment, as companies look to diversify their supply chains away from China.\\\\nRooftop solar installations in industrial parks have grown to meet these companies requirement for renewable energy (and more climate-friendly products). The country has incentivised the growth of renewable energy generation via FiTs in the solar industry. Tariffs for onshore and offshore wind were made more generous in 2018 after poor initial uptake. Coal is still the primary source of electricity production in the country, though slow development of new plants led the government to pivot to solar (and later wind) along with gas to meet its rising energy needs (Government of Vietnam, 2016).\\\\nIn contrast, investment in neighbouring Thailand has been anaemic. This can be partly explained by differences in the two countries’ stages of economic growth, and energy mixes, among other factors. While endowed with similar natural resources, economic growth in the 1990s helped Thailand set up a well functioning and robust power supply. A subsequent decline in economic growth rates slowed energy demand significantly, and Thailand’s demand now lags that of its rapidly industrialising neighbour.\\\\nThailand’s Power Development Plan aims for a 10 GW expansion in solar PV capacity by 2037, whereas Vietnam has targeted an additional 18 GW of solar PV capacity by 2030 and another 18 GW from wind power.\\\\nWith renewable energy growth in Thailand remaining tepid for the foreseeable future, private energy giants such as Super Energy Corp have been increasingly turning to foreign markets, including Vietnam, to fuel growth.\\\\nBoth Vietnam and Thailand have used generous FiTs to help grow the supply of renewable energy. However, Vietnam’s high energy demand and ambitious renewable energy targets have made FiTs a more effective policy tool.\\\\nSource: IRENA, 2023 Box 14 Global trends in Solar Power 44 Solar PV Employment Trends The renewable energy sector employed 12.7 Mn people, directly and indirectly, in 2021.

Solar cell production rose from just 37 MW in 2014 to 3.75 GW; module output increased from 1.2 GW to 8.5 GW in 2021 (Wood Mackenzie, 2022a). The breakneck expansion of domestic solar installations, triggered by high FITs, brought total capacity from 105 MW in 2018 to 17 GW in 2020.\\\\nAs a result, the country’s electricity grid became severely overloaded, leading to curtailments. Despite some grid improvements, the domestic solar PV expansion came to an abrupt halt in 2021, and emphasis shifted to off-grid rooftop deployment.\\\\nThe unprecedented installations in 2020 resulted in significant economic activity and job creation. More than a hundred new installation companies were set up in south-central Ninh Thuan province, which was home to around 2.5 GW of installations in 2021.\\\\nAs installations shot up, Vietnam’s solar PV workforce rose to 1,26,300 jobs in 2020. In 2021, the lack of installations apart from the rooftop additions has resulted in reduction of the workforce.\\\\nIn the Pacific, Australia completed some of its largest solar projects in 2021, according to the Clean Energy Council (2022). New capacity additions included 3.3 GW of small-scale solar and 1.2 GW of large-scale solar.\\\\nThe Clean Energy Council reports another 9.3 GW worth of renewable energy projects under construction or financially committed at the end of 2021, representing over 35,000 jobs, including almost 21,000 in New South Wales.

A variety of pervasive factors interact at the individual, institutional, and societal levels that directly limit women’s inclusion in the sector, including: • Gender and Social Norms - Gender norms and intrahousehold dynamics inhibit women’s access to energy technologies. In addition, men are the main purchasers of energy products, even when women are the primary end users; this results in skewed consumer data and products that do not always reflect the needs or preferences of women. As in other sectors, gender norms and bias, as well as broader systemic barriers, limit women’s ability to enter the workforce and obtain funding.\\\\n• Lack of appropriate financing for women-owned and led businesses - Although financial institutions increasingly design gender-neutral policies and services, these tend to reflect the preferences of men. Research shows that women’s businesses may, for example, need a combination of financial and nonfinancial products and services, including training, mentoring, networking, and other advisory services. Specifically, for early-stage off-grid energy enterprises, financing for women to grow and sustain their businesses is limited. Microfinance and traditional rural village savings and loan associations and cooperatives are the most common financing options available to women.\\\\n• Lack of policies that address gender inequality in the solar sector - Gender discrimination in laws, policies, and regulations prohibit and inhibit women from accessing the benefits of energy services and from actively participating in the sector. The 2021 Women, Business and the Law (World Bank, 2021) reports that 75 countries limit women’s property rights in some form, and various legal barriers prevent women from working in specific sectors and occupations. Renewable energy policies and frameworks can be catalytic in introducing labor conditions that are conducive to women’s active participation in the sector, although even when energy frameworks include some gender considerations, women are mostly characterized as potential beneficiaries rather than as agents of change.\\\\n▪Energy equity aims to ensure that disadvantaged communities have equal access to clean energy and are not disproportionately affected by pollution. It requires fair and distribution of benefits in the energy system through intentional design of systems, technology, procedures and policies.\\\\n▪Committing to equity in clean energy programs, policies, and investments can improve and expand clean energy services and technologies for marginalized groups while creating more just processes, outcomes, and systems.\\\\n▪Clean energy services can reduce energy costs, create jobs, and promote the health, safety, and well-being of residents.\\\\n▪Policymakers, utilities and other decision makers can address these energy burden disparities through clean energy policies and programs.\\\\n▪Equitable energy policies often improve energy access and affordability, procedural justice, economic participation and community ownership, and health and environmental impacts.\\\\nSolar & Energy Equity Global trends in Solar Power 52 Way Forward Despite the ongoing expansion of renewables around the world, significant challenges remain which include: • Certain renewable power markets follow a boom-bust cycle due to short-term, unpredictable policy making, as evidenced in 2021 by the surge in offshore wind power in China to meet a feed-in tariff deadline and by the collapse of Vietnam’s solar PV market after two years of generous incentives.\\\\n• Transmission bottlenecks and network expansion in some countries have held back the deployment of renewables.\\\\n• Unstable supply chains (related to a concentration of technology suppliers in few countries) can delay projects and raise costs, leading to unpredictable price rises that put pressure on the economic validity of projects.\\\\n• Local capacity and knowledge gaps remain a challenge during the construction and operation phases in emerging markets and remote locations.\\\\nFuture editions of the “Global trends in Solar power” report will aim towards capturing the global and regional level insights related to the solar sector which are quintessential in further reinforcing the analysis for ISA Member countries. Also, in the upcoming editions, greater emphasis will be given to include the best and emerging practices in the area of policy, technology and market eco-system in the ISA member countries.\\\\nInclusion & analysis of new chapters pertaining to the Solar market ecosystem, desired key trends in the global solar market related to digital and emerging technologies etc are some other additional initiatives to enhance the outcomes and outreach of Global trends in Solar Power.\\\\nEfforts towards addressing the development of solar sector as mentioned above, should be

Renewable energy is increasingly becoming a vital component of the energy mix of the 21st century, and its successful penetration of the market is already underway in many EU Member States. This publication examines examples of successful implementation of renewable energy projects through case studies and analysis of EU Member State policies and activities. The experiences described may help policy implementers in the Member States to learn from each other’s experiences. We hope these success stories will breed further successes. I believe that this publication could be useful not only to EU decision makers and policy implementers but also to all countries interested in increasing their levels of renewable energy sources. The report sheds light on the factors that led to successful implementation of some renewable energy technologies in some EU Member States and emphasizes the wide range of factors that can determine whether projects succeed or not. All examples studied are reported following the same methodology and format, thus creating a framework for reporting on success stories that others could also use as a communication tool for promoting renewables. This document is also available in electronic format on the Agency’s main web site at http://reports.eea.eu.int/ as well as in EnviroWindows, an EEA web site for gathering and disseminating information on environmental management and best practices, aimed at businesses, local authorities and their stakeholders (http://ewindows.eu.org/ LocalAuthorities/renewables.pdf). It is my hope that this report will become the seed for the creation of a clearing house for experiences in how best to promote renewable energies at many levels, from national to local. The Agency is offering its electronic space and expertise to anybody who would like to pick up the gauntlet and create a permanent site where success stories on implementation of renewable energies are reported in a standardised way and updated when new data become available.\\\\nI would like to thank the manager of this report, Aphrodite Mourelatou, for the valuable work she put into this project; Ecotec Research and Consulting Ltd, who assisted with writing the report; Eurostat, which provided the necessary data; and all others who contributed to the report or reviewed it.\\\\nDomingo Jiménez-Beltrán Executive Director 4 Renewable energies: success stories Contents Foreword . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 Executive summary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1.\\\\nIntroduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2.\\\\nBackground . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 2.1.\\\\nThe importance of renewable energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 2.2.\\\\nTargets for renewable energy use in the EU . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2.2.1.

By analysing these cases it seeks to understand the factors that influence the success of renewable energy schemes and to facilitate their widespread penetration in the Member States. The study aims to provide policy-makers and policy implementers with an opportunity to learn from each others\\' experiences, and thereby to contribute to EU and Member State efforts to meet their renewable energy indicative targets for 2010.\\\\nIdentifying progress in renewable energy deployment The study evaluates the rate of penetration in each EU Member State of four renewable energy sources — photovoltaics, solar thermal, wind and biomass (as biomass power, biomass district heating and biofuels) — between 1993 and 1999. For consistency purposes only data from Eurostat (the statistical office of the European Communities) have been used. For the purposes of this study, two selection criteria have been applied to identify those Member State/technology combinations where renewable energy has penetrated to a greater degree of success than in others: • An absolute increase equivalent to at least 10 % of the total EU-wide increase in renewable energy output of that particular technology over the period 1993–99. The 10 % threshold has been selected to identify those Member States that made the greatest contribution to the increase in renewable energy output of each technology in the EU.\\\\n• A percentage increase of renewable energy output of the examined technology greater than the EU percentage increase for that technology between 1993–1999. This compares the percentage increase of each renewable energy source with the EU-wide percentage increase, and identifies those Member State/technology combinations which exceeded the EU-wide figure.\\\\nThis approach enables the identification of those Member State/technology combinations where exploitation of the technology was well established in 1993 and continued to expand over the next six years. It also highlights Member States where a technology was in an initial stage of development at the start of the six-year period and achieved a rapid rate of increase in penetration, but still only provides a limited quantity of energy output.\\\\nIt should be noted that the criteria cannot be used to directly benchmark a country\\'s performance in promoting renewable energies. The study focuses on positive changes during the period studied, and does not compare absolute levels of penetration.\\\\nThe results of applying these two criteria are summarised in the table below.\\\\nExecutive summary 7 Biomass district heating refers to heat output from heat plants only.\\\\nNote 1: Two criteria for selection are used: ! (left) represents a contribution of at least 10 % of the total EU increase in absolute terms, 1993–99; ! (right) represents a percentage increase greater than the EU percentage increase, 1993–99.\\\\nNote 2: Biofuels only: ! represents those Member States which indicate that they use biofuels (most do not).\\\\nThe results show wide variations between the 15 Member States (see Table 3 on page 21).\\\\nFor most technologies, only two or three Member States contributed more than 10 % (each) of the total new output from the technology: — Germany and Spain contributed 78 % of new EU output from photovoltaics; — Austria, Germany and Greece contributed 80 % of new solar thermal installations; — Denmark, Germany and Spain contributed 80 % of new wind output; — Finland and Sweden contributed 60 % of new generation from biomass-fuelled power stations (including biomass combined heat and power stations); — Austria and Sweden dominated the increase in output from biomass district heating installations; — only four Member States use biofuels to any significant extent; France is the market leader, producing about 40 % of the total.\\\\nMore Member States, however, were starting to expand their rates of exploitation of certain technologies, and had a percentage increase greater than the EU figure. Indeed, some Member States with low initial levels of renewable energy use demonstrated rapid growth rates even though the actual increase in output achieved was small over the period.\\\\nOnly a small number of Member State/technology combinations met both criteria. Germany achieved the greatest levels of new renewable energy penetration over the period and met both criteria for all of the technologies studied except biomass. There were also positive combinations in Austria, Spain and Sweden.\\\\nSuccess factors The study drew on the considerable amount of previous work carried out at EU and Member State level on the barriers that hinder the implementation of renewable energies. It identifies a number of potential success factors likely to have a positive influence on the development of renewable energy technologies.\\\\nTrends in renewable energy penetration, 1993–99 Technology: Selection criteria (see note 1): Photo-voltaics Solar thermal Wind Biomass: power Biomass: district heating (1993–98) Biomass: biofuels (see note 2) Austria ! !\\\\n!\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\nBelgium !\\\\nDenmark !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nFinland !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nFrance !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nGermany ! !\\\\n! !\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nGreece !\\\\nIreland !\\\\n!\\\\nItaly !\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\n!\\\\nLuxembourg Netherlands !\\\\n!\\\\nPortugal !\\\\nSpain ! !\\\\n! !\\\\n!\\\\nSweden !\\\\n!\\\\n! !\\\\nUK !\\\\nSource: Eurostat.\\\\n8 Renewable energies: success stories The study examines the influence of these potential success factors in a series of case studies selected from the Member State/technology combinations that have been identified by applying the selection criteria summarised in the table above. In particular, it examines all Member State/technology combinations that met both of the criteria for successful penetration and the most interesting Member State/technology combinations meeting one of the criteria. Where possible and appropriate, representative examples of renewable energy projects have been used in the case studies.\\\\nThe following conclusions summarise the results of the analysis carried out, based on the case studies.\\\\nNo single factor was identified as being of overwhelming significance. It is rather the cumulative benefits of a series of supportive measures that determine the extent to which a renewable technology is successfully exploited. There are, however, certain essential components of successful renewable energy implementation that help to create an environment in which renewable energy exploitation can succeed.\\\\nThese are described below under the following seven sub-headings: political; legislative; fiscal, financial; administrative; technological development; information, education and training: Political support • The EU countries which showed a rapid expansion of renewable energy during the 1990s are most commonly those with long-established policies in support of renewable energy in general or of a particular renewable energy.\\\\nRegional energy policies can also contribute towards encouraging renewable energy development. For Member States with a high degree of regional autonomy, such as Austria, Germany and Spain, many regional authorities have brought forward energy plans that are even more supportive towards renewable energy than those at the national level.\\\\nLegislative support • For electricity from renewable sources, the feed-in law system has given a great impetus to renewable energy developments, in particular wind energy. This system combines commercially favourable guaranteed feed-in tariffs with an obligation on utilities to purchase renewable electricity at these tariffs.\\\\nDenmark, Germany and Spain (all countries using the feed-in law system) contributed 80 % of new wind energy output in the EU-15 over the period 1993–99.\\\\nBiomass use in power stations also benefited from feed-in laws, particularly in these same three countries. However, the expansion of biomass power has not been as rapid as that of wind. Biomass use also increased significantly in some Member States without the support of a feed-in mechanism (Finland and Sweden). Successful biomass development benefits from feed-in tariffs but is also closely linked with other success factors, especially the availability of financial support (see below).\\\\nThe use of photovoltaics expanded significantly in those Member States that provided a high level of support to projects through feed-in arrangements — the most successful being Germany and Spain. However, successful penetration occurred where the feed-in support initiatives were implemented together with capital subsidy programmes to encourage uptake of the technology (again Germany and, to a lesser extent, Spain).\\\\nThe main alternative to the feed-in mechanism is the competitive tendering process. This system was chosen by Ireland and the UK (1) to support a range of technologies, including wind and biomass, and by France (2) to support wind energy. Developers are guaranteed that, if they win the tender, their power will be purchased at the price they bid in their proposal. This resulted in an increase in capacity of a range of renewable energy technologies in these (1) The UK is replacing the competitive tendering system with a Renewables Obligation, under which suppliers are legally obliged to provide an increasing proportion of their supplies from renewable sources.\\\\n(2) From June 2001 France replaced competitive tendering with a system similar to the feed-in law.\\\\nExecutive summary 9 Member States, but not to the same extent as was achieved where feed-in arrangements were available. Compared with feed-in arrangements in other Member States, the competitive nature of the tendering system has offered fewer guarantees to developers that they will receive an acceptable tariff rate for their project.\\\\n• Renewable energy power generators need grid access to be able to distribute the electricity generated. This requires the establishment of transparent and reasonable charging structures so they can operate successfully within the electricity supply system.\\\\nMember States that took the biggest steps to address problems of grid access achieved the greatest levels of renewable electricity penetration during the 1990s, especially for smaller-scale renewable energy projects.\\\\nGrid access is an important component of the recently adopted EU directive (3) on renewable energy in the internal electricity market. The directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity produced from renewable sources and encourages such electricity to be given priority access to the grid.\\\\nFiscal support • Fiscal (taxation) measures are increasingly being used as a mechanism to reward the environmental benefits of renewable energy compared with energy generated from fossil sources.\\\\nDuring the period of this study, at least six Member States — Austria, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Netherlands and Sweden — put in place some form of energy-related taxation which penalises the use of fossil fuels or other environmentally damaging activities. In Sweden, the introduction of taxes on carbon dioxide emissions and energy from which biomass is exempted helped the expansion of both biomass district heating and biomass combined heat and power plants. The taxes made other options, in particular coal-fired district heating and coal-fired combined heat and power plants, more expensive.\\\\nAn alternative fiscal approach developed in other Member States is to allow various tax exemptions or reductions for individuals or companies who invest in or use renewable-related products or services. The installation of solar thermal water-heating systems has been stimulated by this approach (in Greece, for example). Individual investors in wind energy benefit from tax exemptions in Germany and Sweden, while Dutch companies benefit from accelerated depreciation for investment in energy-saving schemes that include renewable projects.\\\\nBiofuels for transport represent a special example of the role of fiscal initiatives to support renewable energy. Some Member States took advantage of opportunities to apply lower fuel excise duty rates to support biofuels. France in particular used this option to stimulate the growth of the EU’s largest biofuels industry.\\\\nFinancial support • The capital costs of renewable energy projects, which are often high, can be a significant barrier to development, especially for newer technologies. Subsidies or favourable loans for renewable energy developments are common where successful penetration occurs.\\\\nWind energy has become increasingly cost-competitive over the 1990s, and grants are required less often where feed-in arrangements are available. Where such arrangements are not available, subsidies are still the main mechanism for successfully supporting wind energy schemes.\\\\nBiomass installations usually still need capital subsidy to be financially viable as they have high capital costs. This is true even in countries with feed-in arrangements. For example, capital (3) Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (2001/77/EC).\\\\n10 Renewable energies: success stories grants are provided for biomass power schemes in Germany to augment feed-in tariffs, but for wind power only limited grants are currently provided.\\\\nPhotovoltaics (PV) is still an immature technology and projects need considerable subsidy. Member States showing significant increases in PV use are those that have established subsidy support mechanisms, usually in association with feed-in tariff arrangements.\\\\nSolar thermal installations are not always able to compete on costs with fossil fuel heating sources and require subsidies to achieve a high level of uptake. Substantial subsidies were made available to households or industry in the three Member States showing the greatest level of development of solar thermal power over the period of this study (Austria, Germany and Greece).\\\\nAdministrative support • Successful replication of renewable energy projects can be achieved on a wide scale only where there is active support for renewable energy at the level at which individual projects are brought forward for approval. In most cases this is the local or regional level. Administrative support at national level is also an important component for success.\\\\nThe case studies identified a wide range of ways in which local or regional administrations or municipalities have successfully supported renewable energy uptake, including: — developing local or regional targets for renewable energy uptake; — providing planning guidance for locating renewable projects; — providing funding support for local renewable energy projects; — improving building regulations to stimulate uptake of photovoltaics or solar thermal installations; — implementing district heating schemes; — supporting the development of new indigenous manufacturing capacity.\\\\nSome of the projects studied received a strong level of public sector support at regional or local level. This shows the regional or local authorities’ appreciation of the benefits that the projects would bring to the local population not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of economic development and employment.\\\\nTechnological development • The development of renewable energy technologies requires support at all stages — research, demonstration and implementation — to help achieve strong and competitive indigenous industry capabilities in renewable energy.\\\\nPublic sector funding to develop renewable energy has been provided over the past 20 years, both by the European Commission and at Member State level. This support has helped to achieve considerable cost reductions and technological improvements. Member States that have focused national research funding support towards specific technologies are now reaping the rewards of this investment. For example, Denmark now has the world’s leading wind industry, Finland and Sweden have strong capabilities in biomass technologies, and Germany and the Netherlands are home to photovoltaic cell manufacturing.\\\\nInformation, education and training • Activities that raise awareness of the benefits of renewable energy among the general public are a vital component of national, regional and local renewable energy support programmes.\\\\nThe success of a renewable energy project, and its subsequent replication, ultimately depends on its public acceptability at local level. At this level, communicating the non-energy benefits is an important component in the acceptability of renewable energy, especially its role in providing revenue and local jobs. Cooperative participation in a project can be a successful way of involving the local community in a new renewable energy development. The role of the developer could also be important for public acceptance and requires that developers Executive summary 11 work with the local community to provide information about the nature of new renewable energy projects and their potential benefits.\\\\nEnergy agencies at local or regional level are one of the most successful initiatives to help raise public awareness of the benefits of renewable energy and increase public acceptance of new renewable energy developments. Their role is to stimulate the expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency in their area through public and private sector initiatives and local community involvement.\"}, {\"title\": \"2025 Renewable Energy Trends in Asia\", \"url\": \"https://energytracker.asia/renewable-energy-trends-in-asia/\", \"content\": \"Fossil Fuel\\\\n       Coal\\\\n       Oil and Gas\\\\n       Petroleum\\\\n       Natural Gas\\\\n       Hydrogen\\\\n       Greenwashing\\\\n\\\\n   Region\\\\n       Southeast Asia\\\\n           Bangladesh\\\\n           Cambodia\\\\n           Indonesia\\\\n           India\\\\n           Malaysia\\\\n           Philippines\\\\n           Singapore\\\\n           Thailand\\\\n           Vietnam\\\\n\\\\n       East Asia\\\\n           Japan\\\\n           South Korea\\\\n\\\\n       Others\\\\n\\\\n   Blog\\\\n       Case Studies\\\\n       Energy Transition Inspiration\\\\n       Opinion Pieces [...] In a nutshell, there are just a handful of markets where the technology is proving economically feasible.

Region\\\\n=======================================================\\\\n\\\\n Aside from leading the world in solar PV and onshore wind deployment, the Asia-Pacific region, led by China, will also accelerate the deployment and further increase innovations in alternative clean energy technologies such as offshore wind, floating solar and green hydrogen. \\\\n\\\\n26 January 2025 – by _Viktor Tachev_**Comments (0)**\\\\n\\\\nLanguages (English)\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will once again set the **renewable energy trends** for the global energy transition. From increased solar PV and onshore wind deployment to advancing green technologies such as offshore wind power, floating solar, batteries, EVs and green hydrogen, Asia will again lead the global decarbonisation journey. The initial signs are that this won’t fly under the radar of energy transition investors, who will continue to look favourably toward the Asia Pacific as the preferred region for their investments.\\\\n\\\\n**The Top Renewable Energy Trends in Asia in 2025**\\\\n---------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, China is likely to surpass its target of having 1,200 GW of clean power by 2030, reaching [1,500 GW](https://ember-energy.org/data/2030-global-renewable-target-tracker/), while its CO 2 emissions have already peaked or will do so in [2025](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/chinas-co2-emissions-have-peaked-or-will-in-2025-say-44-of-experts-in-survey). Projections reveal that between now and 2030, China will account for nearly [60%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/09/china-to-head-green-energy-boom-with-60-of-new-projects-in-next-six-years) of all renewable energy capacity installed worldwide. By the decade’s end, the country will have over 50% of the world’s renewables. Alongside India, it will be the engine behind the accelerated deployment of renewables. Between now and 2030, clean energy is expected to roll out at three times the pace of the previous six years.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels today exceeds [80%](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary). The country is also home to the world’s top 10 solar PV manufacturing equipment suppliers and has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV. According to the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary), the world will almost completely rely on China to supply key building blocks for solar panel production through 2025.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to wind, the [Global Wind Energy Council](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf) finds that the onshore wind capacity in the APAC region could more than double to 1,084 GW by the decade’s end.\\\\n\\\\nNot only will ground-mounted solar PV and onshore wind energy capacity be deployed faster than ever in Asia, but accompanying green technologies will make major leaps.\\\\n\\\\n### **1.****Offshore Wind**\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the [Global Wind Energy Council](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf), the Asia-Pacific region possesses some of the most attractive onshore and offshore wind resources globally and could play a pivotal role in the global energy transition. By 2030, over 122 GW of new capacity could come online, taking the cumulative regional total to 162 GW.\\\\n\\\\nAs with other green technologies, China will be by far the largest onshore and offshore wind market. By 2030, China will have around 130 GW of offshore wind. Japan and South Korea have already held offshore wind auctions, with the first awarded projects to come online from 2026, deploying 4 and 6 GW, respectively. Vietnam is working towards deploying 6 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 70–91.5 GW by 2050. From 2024 to 2030, operational offshore wind capacity in APAC is set to increase sixfold.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAPAC Offshore Wind Supply Chain Potential by 2030. Source: [GWEC](https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/APAC-report-2024_FINAL_web.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, [APAC’s wind turbine supply](https://energynews.pro/en/wind-turbines-booming-in-asia-pacific-challenges-for-western-manufacturers/) dwarfs that of manufacturers from the rest of the world. Furthermore, most of the demand comes from within the region, positioning the local industry for significant growth in the upcoming years.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, to maximise the region’s potential and meet the 2030 targeted wind installations, GWEC recommends that APAC governments prioritise scaling up regional supply chains. Crucial on that front would be increasing the public support for supply chain capacity building outside of auctions to boost resilience and ease the price pressure on developers. According to experts, international collaboration to scale up the floating wind supply chain would also be of great importance. South Korea’s [Floating Wind](https://koreafloatingwind.kr/en-home) project, which will consist of between 60 and 100 wind turbines, with power expected in 2028, and [Doosan Enerbility’s Changwon plant](https://www.equinor.co.kr/en/news/equinor-signs-mou-with-siemens-gamesa-and-doosan-enerbility-on-ulsan-bandibuli-floating-offshore-wind-project) are shining examples of global cooperation in the field.\\\\n\\\\n### **2. Floating and Rooftop Solar****Panels**\\\\n\\\\n[Wood Mackenzie](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/11/20/wood-mackenzie-forecasts-77-gw-of-floating-solar-by-2033/) projects that APAC will be home to nine of the top 10 global floating solar markets. Together, they will account for 57 of the 77 GW of installed floating solar capacity globally by 2033. India, China and Indonesia will be the three largest markets.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, China already opened the [world’s largest](https://www.pv-tech.org/chinas-chn-energy-completes-worlds-largest-open-sea-floating-solar-pv-project/) open-sea floating solar project – a 1 GW power plant in the Shandong Province. However, growth is also expected in Southeast Asian countries.\\\\n\\\\n[Rystad Energy](https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/floating-pv-southeast-asia) expects floating PV to play a key role in Southeast Asia’s solar expansion, accounting for 10% of the region’s total solar capacity by 2030. The experts identify the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand as the countries leading this growing trend.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nSource: [Rystad Energy](https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/floating-pv-southeast-asia)\\\\n\\\\nVietnam has emerged as the [world’s second-leading](https://www.statista.com/statistics/668749/regional-distribution-of-solar-pv-module-manufacturing/) solar panel manufacturer after China and plans to continue advancing on that route through [supportive policies and incentives](https://energytracker.asia/publications/).In 2024, the country [issued](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnam-draft-decree-on-rooftop-solar-power-new-opportunities-on-the-horizon-for-investors.html/) policy guidelines for the rooftop solar market to stimulate self-produced and self-consumed solar energy in a bid to create favourable conditions and attract foreign investors to Vietnam’s renewable sector. According to the [IEA](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf), based on today’s deployment plans, Vietnam will remain Southeast Asia’s largest renewable power market by a wide margin. The country’s efforts to equip [half](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/18f3ed24-4b26-4c83-a3d2-8a1be51c8cc8/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf) of the office buildings and homes with rooftop solar panels will prove crucial for this development.\\\\n\\\\nLike Vietnam, the Philippines has also initiated [strategic policies and regulations](https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2024/10/Report-ASEANs-clean-power-pathways-2024.pdf) to boost rooftop solar power deployment.\\\\n\\\\nMalaysia’s government also plans to make the country a key player in the global green technology supply chain. It has already claimed a spot among the [world’s leading](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) solar PV manufacturers after China, Vietnam and Thailand.\\\\n\\\\n### **3. EVs and Batteries**\\\\n\\\\nIn October 2024, China’s share of the global electric car market rose spectacularly to [76%](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/03/chinas-share-of-global-electric-car-market-rises-to-76). After seeing its green vehicle sales jump 40% domestically while exports soared 20% in 2024, China will continue leading the global EV transition in 2025 as well. While exports are likely to [slow down](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-car-sales-extend-gains-dec-2025-01-09/) this year, [IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2024 report](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024) sees the country responsible for over 50% of EV sales globally – a target China initially set for [2035](https://reglobal.org/china-could-surpass-a-50-ev-sales-share-by-2025-iea/). Other [analysts](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/12/23/ev-sales-outlook-2025-china-growth-analysts/) expect China to have an even greater share in global electric vehicle sales this year.\\\\n\\\\nOther Asian markets, such as Vietnam and Thailand, also promise to make strides in EV manufacturing. The former is already manufacturing [EVs](https://kpmg.com/vn/en/home/insights/2024/07/the-ev-landscape-in-vietnam.html) domestically, while in 2024, for example, China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, opened its first [EV factory](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-byd-opens-ev-factory-thailand-first-southeast-asia-2024-07-04/) in Southeast Asia in Thailand.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding battery technology, China will continue to lead the world in the upcoming years. As per the [IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/outlook-for-battery-and-energy-demand), its total committed battery manufacturing capacity will remain two times greater than its domestic demand by 2030, opening opportunities for exports. Aside from manufacturing, the country will advance [global battery recycling capacity](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/outlook-for-battery-and-energy-demand), 80% of which occurred in China in 2023. For reference, Europe and the United States are responsible for under 2% each. By 2030, global recycling capacity could exceed 1,500 GWh, of which 70% could be from China.\\\\n\\\\nVietnam plans to capitalise on the fact that it holds the world’s [second-largest](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) rare earth resources by increasing domestic production and becoming a key cog in the global critical minerals supply chain.\\\\n\\\\nTogether with Vietnam and Indonesia, Malaysia will be responsible for around [1%](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) of the committed battery manufacturing capacity globally in 2030. In 2024, it announced plans to build the [region’s largest](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/09/11/lahad-datu039s-energy-storage-system-to-be-region039s-largest) battery energy storage system project.\\\\n\\\\nThailand is already home to Southeast Asia’s [first lithium-ion battery gigafactory](https://www.nationthailand.com/business/corporate/40037092).\\\\n\\\\nThe Philippines is building [the world’s largest solar and battery storage power plant](https://www.energy-storage.news/philippines-president-breaks-ground-at-worlds-largest-solar-and-battery-storage-power-plant/). Currently, alongside Indonesia, it forms the world’s top nickel producers, accounting for about [65%](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ac357b64-0020-421c-98d7-f5c468dadb0f/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) of global mined production. Under the new leadership, Indonesia also aims to continue marching toward becoming a nickel mining centre for [EV batteries](https://energytracker.asia/indonesias-energy-policy-under-the-new-president-prabowo-subianto/).\\\\n\\\\n### **4. Green Hydrogen**\\\\n\\\\nIn the past two years, reputable analysis desks from [BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/), [Citibank](https://www.citifirst.com.hk/home/upload/citi_research/rsch_pdf_30174354.pdf) and [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/ce/en/events/SkillSphere/reality-check-global-hydrogen-economy-edition-2.html) have all issued reports calling the clean hydrogen market situation a “reality check”.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to [BNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/), while a supportive policy environment and a maturing project pipeline will make clean H 2 supply skyrocket 30-fold to 16.4 million tonnes per year by 2030, it won’t meet most government targets. Furthermore, the experts expect just a third of the 1,600 projects announced to date to materialise and often later than planned. Of these, half would be green hydrogen.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAsia Pacific Hydrogen Demand by Sector and Country (in MtH2).

According to a Wood Mackenzie [analysis](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/), in 2025, these would be regions that leverage cheap solar and wind power and benefit from government incentives that reduce costs and ensure financial viability. Cases in point are China and India.The experts note that the ability to ensure competitive pricing, shorter delivery times and strong manufacturing capacity will prove huge competitive advantages for Chinese electrolysers, which will capture a third of the global market outside the EU and North America. China plans to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity, including adding over 10 GW of capacity this year.\\\\n\\\\nYet, Wood Mackenzie’s [analysis](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/) notes that the lack of transparency regarding offtake contracts across China makes assessing the full extent of uncontracted volumes in the country difficult. The uncertainty is also highlighted by [BNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/hydrogen-supply-outlook-2024-a-reality-check/).\\\\n\\\\n![Image 11: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nMarket Penetration of Chinese Equipment Outside the EU and North America Will Exceed One-third by the End of 2025. Source: [Wood Mackenzie](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/)\\\\n\\\\nSoutheast Asia will also mark progress in green hydrogen, mainly due to benefitting from low-cost renewable energy and [affordable electrolysers](https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/hydrogen-2025-outlook/thank-you/) from Chinese manufacturers. According to [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/south-east-asia-hydrogen-generation-market), Indonesia will emerge as the region’s leading green hydrogen production market in the years up to 2030.\\\\n\\\\nS&P Global [expects](https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/energy-transition/121124-commodities-2025-asia-pacifics-low-carbon-hydrogen-tenders-to-test-readiness-for-clean-fuel-trades) Japan and South Korea to be very active on the green hydrogen front, although it sees Asia’s pipeline experiencing major project cancellations and readjustments to original strategies in 2025. However, policy fragmentation and high production costs are expected to remain [significant hurdles](https://eastasiaforum.org/2025/01/04/regional-partnerships-can-power-a-resilient-asia-pacific-hydrogen-ecosystem/).\\\\n\\\\n**Asia To Continue Attracting Investors With Private Capital While Initiatives Play a Crucial Role**\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2023) finds that investments in Asia’s clean electricity sector significantly outweigh those in fossil fuels, and the growth of coal power is declining. However, a more in-depth view reveals that Asia’s investment landscape is one of extremes. China has established itself as the [undisputed global leader](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-investment-in-clean-energy-by-selected-country-and-region-2019-and-2024) in clean energy investment growth between 2019 and 2024, while India ranks fourth after the US and the EU. Southeast Asia’s spending on clean energy makes up only about [2%](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/southeast-asia) of the global total.\\\\n\\\\nTo stay on track with the Paris Agreement, BloombergNEF estimates that Asia-Pacific countries would need[USD 88.7 trillion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/asia-pacific-needs-greater-public-private-commitment-and-us88-7-trillion-in-investments-to-stay-on-track-for-paris-agreement/) in investments. This is the total capital needed from all stakeholders, including companies, financial institutions, governments and consumers. Furthermore, the figures are just 20% higher compared to an Economic Transition Scenario (BNEF’s base case scenario), and the falling costs of low-carbon solutions, such as EVs and clean power, and new policy commitments will help close the spending gap between the two scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 13: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nAsia Pacific Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario.

For example, the investments in the period between 2024 and 2030 should be triple the 2023 levels to align with the Paris Agreement’s goals.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 15: Cumulative Energy Investment and Spending Across 2024-2050 in Selected Asia Pacific Markets, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario, Source: BloombergNEF](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\\\\n\\\\nEnergy Transition Investment in Asia Pacific – 2023 Estimate Versus Required Annualized Levels Across 2024-2050, Economic Transition Scenario and Net Zero Scenario.

Source: [BloombergNEF](https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/Asia-Pacifics-energy-transition-outlook_FINAL.pdf)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, investors are looking favourably toward Asia. According to [KPMG](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/sg/pdf/2024/11/energy-transition-investment-outlook-2025-and-beyond.pdf), the recent progress on the regulatory front has helped create a more welcoming investment environment and established East Asia as the most preferred region for energy transition investors over the past two years. The consultancy finds that 2025 will be no different. While KPMG advises investors to move early into emerging markets to gain rewards, Asian governments must continue improving their regulatory frameworks to convince private capital holders that their markets are quickly maturing and capable of limiting investment risks. Governmental intervention and introduction of policies, such as feed-in tariffs, regulatory support, tax incentives, direct investments, subsidies and research and development grants are deemed most important for driving investments into energy transition technologies in APAC going forward.\\\\n\\\\n0\\\\n\\\\n[#### by Viktor Tachev](https://energytracker.asia/renewable-energy-trends-in-asia/#Viktor-Tachev)\\\\nViktor has years of experience in financial markets and energy finance, working as a marketing consultant and content creator for leading institutions, NGOs, and tech startups.

Updated quantitative data reveal that Sweden’s share of renewable energy increased from 53.4% to 66% between 2017 and 2022, still far outpacing France, who grew from 15.8% to 20.3% (Eurostat, n.d.). While Sweden is the top European Union performer by a wide margin, France finds itself struggling. Coming in as the 15th ranked EU country when measured in share of renewable energy, France is some 3% below the EU average. They are also just one of four countries to miss their 2020 renewable energies target in 2022 (\\\\\"Renewable Energy in the European Union,\\\\\" n.d.). Sweden’s success stems from long-term policy consistency, high carbon taxes, and effective market-based mechanisms like the green certificate system (International Energy Agency, 2021; Andersson, 2019; Swedish Energy Agency, 2020). Meanwhile, France’s reliance on nuclear energy and complex permitting processes has slowed renewable energy adoption (Bergek & Berggren, 2014; World Bank Group, 2020).\\\\nIntroduction The global transition to renewable energy is a critical strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting sustainable economic growth (IPCC, 2022). Renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and bioenergy, are essential in lowering carbon footprints and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels (Jacobson et al., 2019). Within the Brown 3 European Union (EU), member states are bound by comprehensive regulatory frameworks and incentive programs, such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the European Green Deal, designed to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and achieve the EU’s ambitious climate goals (European Commission, 2023a, 2019). These policies offer financial incentives, promote infrastructure investment, and support market-based mechanisms like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), encouraging the transition towards a greener energy future (European Commission, 2023b; Ellerman & Buchner, 2007).\\\\nDespite these common EU-wide frameworks, there are significant disparities in how member states adopt renewable energy. France and Sweden, two countries on opposite ends of the renewable energy usage spectrum in the European Union, exemplify this divergence. These disparities highlight how national-level policy execution, regulatory efficiency, and historical energy reliance shape renewable energy adoption (Bergek & Berggren, 2014; World Bank Group, 2020).\\\\nThe objective of this research is to examine the factors contributing to Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption compared to France’s slower progress, despite both countries having access to the same EU-wide incentive programs. The study aims to analyze the domestic policy decisions, market structures, and societal attitudes that have allowed Sweden to lead in renewable energy adoption while France faces regulatory and policy barriers that have slowed its transition (Andersson, 2019; International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nThis research combines quantitative metrics, such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and renewable energy growth, with qualitative analysis of policy frameworks and cultural factors. Findings highlight Sweden’s significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions Brown 4 (from 1.0 to 0.6 tonnes per capita)(Eurostat, n.d.) and transport sector emissions (148.2 to 66.6 g/km) (Eurostat, n.d.). In contrast, France’s slower progress (6.8 to 5.7 tonnes per capita and 133.8 to 103.1 g/km) underscores regulatory inefficiencies and limited policy alignment. The results emphasize that Sweden’s cohesive domestic policies offer a replicable model for France and other EU countries seeking to enhance renewable energy adoption and meet carbon neutrality goals.\\\\nThe central research question guiding this study is: How has Sweden’s domestic policy execution resulted in more effective renewable energy adoption compared to France, despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide frameworks? The hypothesis is that Sweden’s long-term commitment to stable renewable energy policies, high carbon taxes, and community-driven projects has facilitated its success, while France’s historical dependence on nuclear power, policy fragmentation, and regulatory complexities have slowed its progress (Andersson, 2019; International Energy Agency, 2021). This research will provide insights into the critical role of national policy execution in achieving EU-wide renewable energy goals, offering valuable lessons for other EU countries aiming to enhance their renewable energy strategies.\\\\nBrown 5 Figure 1: Share of Renewable Energy in Gross Final Energy Consumption (2017–2022) Literature Review Government policies play a crucial role in shaping the adoption of renewable energy across European Union (EU) member states (European Parliamentary Research Service, 2016).\\\\nSeveral studies have demonstrated how national-level policy frameworks, financial incentives, and regulatory processes can either facilitate or hinder the transition to renewable energy (European Commission, 2020). The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the European Green Deal provide overarching incentives for all member states to adopt renewable energy technologies (European Commission, 2023). However, the degree of success varies significantly between countries due to differences in how these EU-wide policies are implemented at the national level (European Commission, 2020). Research has consistently shown that stable, well-coordinated national policies are key drivers of renewable energy growth, while fragmented policies and complex regulatory environments tend to slow progress (European Parliamentary Brown 6 Research Service, 2016). Recent figures from the European Union highlight the role of financial mechanisms, such as green bonds, in accelerating renewable energy investments (European Commission, 2023). Sweden’s higher allocation to green bonds (16.2% in 2022) demonstrates the importance of financing strategies in enabling transitions, while France’s lower share (5.9%) reflects an area for growth (Eurostat, n.d.). Similarly, circular economy principles—more pronounced in France—can complement renewable energy strategies by ensuring material efficiency in infrastructure deployment (European Commission, 2023).\\\\nFigure 2: Allocation of Green Bonds as a Share of Total Issuance (2022) Brown 7 Sweden’s Success Factors Sweden is frequently cited as a leader in renewable energy adoption, driven by several key policy initiatives (International Energy Agency, 2019). Its high carbon tax, among the highest globally, has been instrumental in making fossil fuels economically unattractive, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1.0 tonnes per capita in 2017 to 0.6 tonnes in 2022 (Eurostat, n.d.).\\\\nFigure 3: Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2017–2022) The country’s commitment to energy efficiency is evident in the reduction of primary energy consumption per person, which decreased from 4.6 to 4.1 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) per capita—a standard unit of energy that represents the energy content of one tonne of crude oil—during this period (Eurostat, n.d.). Household energy use also saw a decline from 765 to 673 kgoe per capita (Eurostat, n.d.) during this period. These reductions underscore the effectiveness of cohesive, long-term policies (Government Offices of Sweden, 2021).\\\\nBrown 8 Figure 4: Key Household Energy Efficiency Metrics In addition to the carbon tax, Sweden’s green certificate system, implemented in 2003, has been identified as a critical success factor (Sweden.se, 2023). This market-based mechanism incentivizes the production of renewable electricity by requiring utilities to purchase green certificates to meet renewable energy quotas (CMS Law, 2023). Research shows that the predictability and consistency of this system have provided long-term confidence for investors, leading to significant growth in renewable energy infrastructure (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020).\\\\nCommunity engagement is another factor contributing to Sweden’s success (Lund University, 2021). Studies reveal that community ownership of renewable energy projects, particularly in wind energy, has increased public acceptance and participation (Institute for Human Rights and Business, 2022). Community-driven initiatives not only spread the financial benefits of renewable energy projects more equitably but also reduce opposition to new projects, which is often a major barrier in other countries (Lund University, 2021).\\\\nFrance’s Barriers In contrast, France’s progress in renewable energy adoption has been slower, despite operating under the same EU-wide incentive structures (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nFrance has a historical reliance on nuclear power, which supplies over 70% of the country’s Brown 9 electricity (AXA XL, 2023). This points to reduced urgency for renewable energy investments.\\\\nWhile nuclear energy helps France meet its low-carbon goals, it has delayed the diversification of the country’s energy mix (International Energy Agency, 2021). This dependence on nuclear power has created a policy environment less focused on expanding renewables like wind and solar (France 24, 2024).\\\\nFigure 5: Renewable Energy vs Nuclear Energy Share by Country Moreover, France’s regulatory complexities have been a significant obstacle (IDDRI, 2022). Its slower progress is reflected in modest renewable energy growth, increasing from 15.8% to 20.3% between 2017 and 2022. While Sweden reduced transport CO2 emissions to 66.6 g/km, France’s decline to 103.1 g/km highlights its comparatively slower adoption of low-carbon transport technologies.\\\\nBrown 10 Gaps in Existing Literature While previous research has extensively covered the influence of national policies on renewable energy adoption within individual EU countries, there is a gap in the literature concerning direct comparative analyses between countries like Sweden and France, which operate under similar EU-wide incentives but have vastly different outcomes. Few studies have systematically examined the reasons behind Sweden’s superior performance in renewable energy adoption compared to France’s slower progress, considering the impact of domestic policy execution, regulatory frameworks, and cultural factors. This research addresses this gap by providing a detailed comparative analysis of the renewable energy strategies in Sweden and France, focusing on how domestic policies influence the effectiveness of EU-wide incentive programs. By exploring these differences, this study aims to contribute to a better understanding of how national contexts shape the success of renewable energy adoption under EU frameworks.\\\\nMethodology This research employs a comparative analysis of renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden, using a mixed-methods approach that integrates both quantitative and qualitative data. Given the limitations of being an undergraduate study with restricted funding, this research primarily relies on secondary data sources, including government reports, EU databases, academic literature, and case studies. The analysis is designed to understand the effectiveness of domestic policies in implementing EU-wide renewable energy incentive programs and to assess the broader contextual factors that influence renewable energy adoption in both countries.\\\\nBrown 11 Research Design As stated previously, this study follows a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative policy reviews. Quantitative data is used to measure the key metrics of renewable energy adoption, while qualitative analysis provides insights into the domestic policies, regulatory frameworks, and cultural factors that have shaped the renewable energy landscapes in France and Sweden. The comparative analysis framework allows for a systematic evaluation of how different domestic approaches, despite common EU policies, have resulted in divergent outcomes in renewable energy adoption.\\\\nData Collection Data for this research is sourced from a variety of secondary resources, including: ● Government Reports: Official energy reports from both France and Sweden, as well as EU-wide policy documents, provide information on renewable energy targets, policy initiatives, and the implementation of incentive programs.\\\\n● EU Databases: Data from Eurostat and other EU-level databases are used to track renewable energy adoption rates, carbon emission reductions, and financial investments in renewable infrastructure in both countries.\\\\n● Academic Papers: A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed academic studies on renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden is conducted to understand the academic perspective on national policies and their effectiveness.\\\\nBrown 12 ● Case Studies: Existing case studies of renewable energy projects, as well as first-person perspective on multiple SMEs gained throughout the semester.\\\\nQuantitative Metrics The quantitative analysis focuses on several key metrics that allow for a direct comparison of renewable energy adoption between France and Sweden: ● Renewable Energy Adoption Rates: Percentage of energy derived from renewable sources.\\\\n● Energy Consumption: Primary and final energy consumption per capita, providing insights into energy efficiency improvements.\\\\n● Energy Productivity: Growth in economic output (EUR/kgoe) relative to energy use.\\\\n○ kgoe (kilogram of oil equivalent): A standard unit of energy that allows comparison between different types of energy sources (e.g., electricity, natural gas, coal). One kgoe equals approximately: ■ 41.868 megajoules (MJ) ■ 11.63 kilowatt-hours (kWh) ● Carbon Emissions Reductions: Changes in greenhouse gas emissions per capita and transport emissions (g CO2 per km).\\\\n● Social Energy Accessibility: Population unable to keep homes adequately warm, reflecting affordability and inclusivity of energy transitions.\\\\nBrown 13 ● Green Financing: Share of green bonds in total issuance, measuring financial mechanisms supporting renewable energy investments.\\\\nThe quantitative metrics of both countries were analyzed through comparison of publicly available Eurostat metrics to evaluate how well each country has utilized EU-wide incentive programs, as well as to determine the financial and environmental impacts of renewable energy adoption in both contexts.\\\\nQualitative Analysis The qualitative analysis focuses on policy reviews and broader contextual factors that have influenced the success or challenges of renewable energy adoption in each country. Key areas of qualitative analysis include: ● Policy Reviews: A detailed examination of Sweden’s and France’s renewable energy policies, including the implementation of EU-wide directives, domestic incentives like Sweden’s green certificate system (Swedish Business School, 2005), and regulatory challenges in France’s wind energy sector.\\\\n● Public Engagement: Analysis of community involvement in renewable energy projects, particularly in Sweden, where community ownership models have been a driving force behind the success of wind energy projects (Energy, Sustainability and Society, 2023). The research explores the extent to which public acceptance and local involvement have played a role in renewable energy adoption.\\\\nBrown 14 ● Regulatory Frameworks: A review of the regulatory processes in both countries, with a focus on the differences in permitting processes for renewable energy projects, which have been a major barrier in France but more streamlined in Sweden (Tethys, 2021).\\\\nResults The comparative analysis of France and Sweden’s renewable energy adoption reveals significant differences in their progress despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide incentive structures. Quantitative data from the EU and national sources, combined with qualitative policy analysis, highlight the contrasting outcomes in renewable energy growth, financial impacts, and overall policy effectiveness in each country.\\\\nComparative Data on Renewable Energy Growth Sweden’s renewable energy adoption demonstrates remarkable growth underpinned by strong policy frameworks. Between 2017 and 2022: ● As previously mentioned, Sweden’s share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption grew from 53.4% to 66%, an increase of 12.6 percentage points, largely driven by bioenergy, hydropower, and wind (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2022).\\\\n● France’s renewable share increased modestly from 15.8% to 20.3%, reflecting only a 4.5 percentage point increase, hindered by Brown 15 its reliance on nuclear power and slow development of wind energy projects (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\nFigure 6: Renewable Energy Growth by Country (2017 v. 2022) Emissions Reductions Sweden achieved significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions: ● Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions (per capita): Fell from 1.0 tonnes in 2017 to 0.6 tonnes in 2022, highlighting the impact of high carbon taxes and renewable energy growth (Statistics Sweden, 2023).\\\\n● Transport Emissions (CO2 per km): Dropped sharply from 148.2 g/km to 66.6 g/km, showcasing the effectiveness of Sweden’s policies in promoting electric vehicles and low-carbon technologies (Statista, 2024).\\\\nFrance saw slower reductions: ● Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions (per capita): Fell from 6.8 tonnes to 5.7 tonnes, reflecting its slower renewable energy adoption.\\\\nBrown 16 ● Transport Emissions (CO2 per km): Declined from 133.8 g/km to 103.1 g/km, showing moderate progress compared to Sweden.\\\\nFigure 7: Emission Metrics by Country (2017 v. 2022) Energy Efficiency and Accessibility Sweden’s energy consumption improvements: ● Primary Energy Consumption (toe per capita): Reduced from 4.6 to 4.1, reflecting better energy efficiency measures.\\\\n● Final Household Energy Consumption (kgoe per capita): Decreased from 765 to 673, highlighting Sweden’s success in residential energy efficiency.\\\\nFrance’s reductions were also notable but slower: ● Primary Energy Consumption (toe per capita): Declined from 3.6 to 3.0, showing steady but less dramatic improvements.\\\\n● Final Household Energy Consumption (kgoe per capita): Dropped from 620 to 547.\\\\nBrown 17 Sweden also faced a smaller increase in energy accessibility challenges, with the population unable to keep homes adequately warm rising from 2.1% to 3.3%. Again, in France, this figure more than doubled from 4.9% to 10.7%, highlighting possible affordability challenges.\\\\nFigure 8: Population Unable to Keep Homes Warm (% of Population, 2017–2022) Figure 9: Household Energy Metrics by Country (2017 v. 2022) While Sweden has maintained relatively low energy import dependency, increasing marginally from 26.7% to 26.8%, France’s reliance on energy imports has risen significantly from 48.7% to 51.9% (Eurostat, n.d.). This further illustrates Sweden’s Brown 18 self-sufficient energy model compared to France\\'s higher reliance on external energy sources.\\\\nA notable difference also appears in circular material use rates. France demonstrated progress, increasing from 18.7% to 19.3%, emphasizing material efficiency in domestic use. Conversely, Sweden\\'s rate declined from 6.7% to 6.1%, suggesting a need for improvement in material reuse within renewable infrastructure within Sweden, and pointing to an area of relative expertise that France could explore leveraging to increase their usage of renewable energy (Eurostat, n.d.).\\\\nSummary of Findings Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption is the result of a cohesive and consistent policy framework, including high carbon taxes, an effective green certificate system, and strong community engagement (Government Offices of Sweden, n.d.; Sweden.se, n.d.). These policies have enabled Sweden to surpass its renewable energy targets while maintaining a balanced approach to energy accessibility (International Energy Agency, 2021). France’s progress, in contrast, has been hindered by regulatory barriers, policy inconsistency, and its reliance on nuclear energy (International Energy Agency, 2021; France 24, 2024).\\\\nThe findings underscore the critical role of policy stability, energy diversity, and public engagement in driving renewable energy transitions (IDDRI, 2022). Sweden’s model offers valuable lessons for France and other EU countries seeking to enhance their renewable energy strategies.\\\\nBrown 19 Figure 10: Summary of Major Comparative Metrics Brown 20 Discussion Interpretation of Findings The findings reinforce the critical role of stable, long-term policy frameworks in driving renewable energy adoption: ● Sweden: Consistent growth in renewable energy (53.4% to 66%) and substantial emissions reductions (1.0 to 0.6 tonnes per capita) highlight the effectiveness of cohesive policies, including high carbon taxes, green certificates, and streamlined regulatory processes (CMS Law, n.d., Baker McKenzie, n.d.).\\\\n● France: Modest progress in renewables (15.8% to 20.3%) and slower emissions reductions underscore the challenges posed by fragmented policies, nuclear dependency, and bureaucratic delays. The French government has recognized these challenges and, in February 2023, adopted the Renewable Energy Acceleration Bill to address bureaucratic delays and streamline project development. The bill aims to cut red tape and expedite permitting procedures in specific \\'acceleration zones\\' to boost renewable energy production (Cleary Gottlieb, 2023).\\\\nPolicy Implications Possible methods for French acceleration in its renewable energy transition inspired by Sweden: Brown 21 1. Streamline Regulatory Processes: Simplify permitting for wind and solar projects to reduce delays and costs.\\\\n2. Expand Green Financing: Increase the issuance of green bonds, which accounted for 16.2% of total issuance in Sweden by 2022 but only 5.9% in France, to attract private investment.\\\\n3. Improve Energy Accessibility: Develop targeted subsidies or financial assistance programs to address the doubling of populations unable to keep homes warm.\\\\nWhile Sweden\\'s renewable strategy is widely applicable, France’s unique reliance on nuclear power requires solutions that integrate renewable energy with nuclear innovations to achieve progress without sacrificing energy security (International Energy Agency, 2021; Réseau de Transport d\\'Électricité, 2021; Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2024).\\\\nBroader Significance These disparities are not only national challenges but also impact the EU’s collective ability to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goals. Understanding the successes and barriers faced by Sweden and France is critical for designing reusable strategies applicable across member states.\\\\nFigure 11: EU Goal Progress by Country Brown 22 Sweden has maintained relatively low climate-related economic losses, increasing slightly from EUR 10.9 to 11.6 per inhabitant. In contrast, France saw a substantial rise from EUR 43.0 to 50.2 per inhabitant, indicating higher vulnerability to climate-related impacts (Eurostat, n.d.). Energy accessibility challenges are more pronounced in France, highlighting the impact of rising energy costs and social equity considerations in renewable transitions.\\\\nEconomically, the contribution of environmental goods and services to GDP has grown in both countries, with Sweden increasing from 3.5% to 4.1% and France from 2.6% to 3.0% (Eurostat, n.d.). This reflects the broader economic potential of transitioning to a green economy.\\\\nFigure 12: Environmental Value Added as % of GDP Brown 23 Cultural Factors Cultural and societal factors play a critical role in shaping the differences between Sweden and France’s renewable energy adoption rates (Wang, Wang, Yu, & Mao, 2023). In Sweden, a strong cultural emphasis on sustainability is deeply integrated into public policy and corporate behavior (Hjorth Warlenius & Nettelbladt, 2023). This alignment has fostered widespread acceptance and active participation in renewable energy projects. A notable example is the use of community ownership models in wind energy projects, which ensure that local residents share in the economic benefits (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020). These models, paired with participation in decision-making processes, have minimized opposition and created equitable distribution of financial gains, accelerating project approvals (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2016).\\\\nBrown 24 In contrast, France’s public attitudes toward renewable energy are more complex, influenced in part by the country’s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, which already provides a low-carbon alternative (International Energy Agency, 2021). While there is growing awareness of sustainability, wind energy projects in rural areas often face significant opposition. Concerns about visual impact, noise, and ecological disruption have led to delays and legal battles, slowing the adoption of renewables (Wretling, Balfors, & Mörtberg, 2022). Unlike Sweden, France has not fully embraced community ownership models or incentives that directly benefit local stakeholders (Leiren et al., 2020).\\\\nTo overcome these challenges, France could adopt strategies inspired by Sweden’s community-driven approach (Hjorth Warlenius & Nettelbladt, 2023). Implementing policies that encourage local ownership, such as profit-sharing mechanisms or co-ownership of wind farms, could help address opposition by providing tangible economic benefits to residents (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2020). Additionally, fostering participatory planning processes that involve local communities in project design and decision-making could build trust and reduce resistance (European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2016). These measures could create a stronger societal consensus around the need for a rapid energy transition, aligning public sentiment with France’s renewable energy goals.\\\\nLimitations As an undergraduate study with limited funding and resources, this research is subject to several limitations: ● Reliance on Secondary Sources: The analysis relies exclusively on publicly available secondary data sources, such as government reports and Brown 25 academic literature, as there is no primary data collection or direct contact with stakeholders. This limits the scope of the research to existing information, which may not capture the most up-to-date developments in renewable energy policies.\\\\n● Data Availability: In some cases, comprehensive data on specific metrics (such as recent investment levels) may not be equally available for both countries, leading to potential gaps in the analysis.\\\\n● Generalizability: The focus on France and Sweden means that the findings may not be directly applicable to other EU countries with different energy profiles or policy environments. However, the insights generated from this comparison can provide valuable lessons for other EU member states facing similar challenges.\\\\nDespite these limitations, this research aims to provide a complete comparative analysis of renewable energy adoption in France and Sweden, offering insights into how domestic policies and contextual factors influence the success of EU-wide renewable energy programs.\\\\nRecommendations From a higher level perspective, general recommendations can be made for France to accelerate its renewable energy adoption: 1. Simplify Regulatory Processes: Streamlining the permitting process for renewable energy projects, particularly in wind energy, would reduce delays and lower the costs associated with legal and bureaucratic Brown 26 challenges. Expanding the Renewable Energy Acceleration Bill and other policies like it would promote a more efficient regulatory system.\\\\n2. Adopt Long-Term, Stable Policies: France should work toward creating a more stable policy environment for renewable energy investors by reducing the frequency of policy changes and offering consistent financial incentives. This would encourage long-term investments in renewable infrastructure, similar to the confidence-building policies implemented in Sweden (International Energy Agency, 2021).\\\\n3. Increase the Carbon Tax: By raising the carbon tax and using the revenue to fund renewable energy projects, France could create stronger financial incentives for reducing fossil fuel consumption and investing in clean energy alternatives (International Energy Agency, 2021). Sweden’s high carbon tax has been a major driver of its renewable energy success, and a similar approach could benefit France (Government of Sweden, n.d.).\\\\n4. Foster Community-Driven Renewable Projects: France could enhance public acceptance and local support for renewable energy projects by fostering greater community involvement and ownership. Sweden’s community-based approach to wind energy projects has minimized local opposition and ensured that the benefits of renewable energy are shared more broadly across society (Walker & Devine-Wright, 2008).\\\\nConclusion Brown 27 This research has highlighted the significant disparity between Sweden’s success in renewable energy adoption and France’s slower progress, despite both countries operating under the same EU-wide incentive frameworks, such as the Renewable Energy Directive and the European Green Deal. Sweden’s cohesive, stable policy framework, which includes a high carbon tax, the green certificate system, and robust community engagement, has facilitated the rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly in wind, bioenergy, and hydropower. In contrast, France’s progress has been slowed by policy fragmentation, regulatory complexity, and its reliance on nuclear power. Lengthy permitting processes and inconsistent policy have deterred investment and delayed the development of renewable infrastructure in France.\\\\nThese findings demonstrate that Sweden’s long-term policy consistency has been a key factor in its ability to meet and surpass its renewable energy targets, while France’s fragmented approach has created uncertainty and slowed its transition to a more diverse energy mix.\\\\nHowever, there are limitations in relation to the implementation of EU directives. As countries in the EU, such as France and Sweden, differ in a number of demographic categories, many frameworks that work for Sweden will likely require small to moderate modification to fit the infrastructure capacity of said country. Regardless, Sweden’s success in policy and their applications provide a roadmap for other EU countries hoping to follow in their footsteps.\\\\nBrown 28 References Andersson, J. J. (2019).

[Indicators](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators)\\\\n4.  Share of energy consumption from renewable sources in Europe\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy sources represented 24.5% of the European Union’s final energy use in 2023. The share is estimated to have increased by one percentage point since 2022, still largely driven by strong growth in renewable electricity supply. The share is also amplified by a small 2023 reduction in non-renewable energy consumption. Meeting the new minimum EU target of 42.5% for 2030 will demand doubling the rates of renewables deployment seen over the past decade and a deeper transformation of the European energy system.\\\\n\\\\n### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#figure-1-progress-towards-renewable-energy-source-targets-for-eu-27)Figure 1. Progress towards renewable energy source targets for EU-27\\\\n\\\\nRenewable energy sources (RES) have multiple **benefits** for society compared with fossil fuels, such as\\xa0mitigating climate change, reducing the emission of air pollutants and improving energy security. The revised\\xa0[Renewable Energy Directive](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en)\\xa0increases the binding target from 32% to a minimum 42.5% share of renewables in EU energy consumption, with the aim of achieving 45%. Each Member State will contribute to this common target. Targets were not introduced for individual countries.\\\\n\\\\nAt 24.5% in 2023, the share of renewables in the EU increased by one percentage point from 2022. It represents a **historical high** following the adoption of important EU legal frameworks to speed up the clean energy transition. The [Fit-for-55 EU policy package](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal/fit-55-delivering-proposals_en#:~:text=Under%20the%20European%20Climate%20Law,cost%2Deffective%20and%20competitive%20way.) and the higher EU ambitions introduced by the [RepowerEU plan](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en) are especially relevant in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\\\n\\\\nThe 2023 renewable energy share also signals a return to **higher\\xa0growth rates**\\xa0of renewables after a dip in 2021 (figure 1). In absolute values, the gross final consumption of renewables grew by almost seven million tonnes oil equivalent (Mtoe) between 2022 and 2023, driven by a substantial increase in solar power generation (by 19.7%) and wind power (by 9.3%).\\\\n\\\\n**Non-renewables** saw a reduction of 3%, mainly linked to lower utilisation of coal for energy supply. This increased the relative share of renewables in the EU gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe electricity system continued to lead decarbonisation efforts in 2023, with 45.3% of all EU power generated from renewable sources. It was followed by heating and cooling (26.2%) and transport (10.8%), where renewable energy from heat pumps (+13%) and renewable electricity consumption in road transport (+53%) increased notably, compared with 2022.\\\\n\\\\nSolid, gaseous and liquid biomass\\xa0resources together formed the **largest category** in 2023, totalling half of all renewable energy consumption. This may have implications for terrestrial carbon sinks, biodiversity and air pollution if the demand for biomass continues to increase. Solid biomass is most widely used in residential and district heating, electricity generation and industry. Gaseous biomass (biogas) is typically burned to produce heat and power, while liquid biomass fuels (biofuels) are mainly used directly or blended with gasoline and diesel in transport.\\\\n\\\\nWind (17%), hydro power (13%) and solar photovoltaics (9%) were the other three largest renewable energy sources, followed by heat pumps and liquid biofuels (both with an 8% share of all renewable energy use). Other renewables sources\\xa0were biogases, renewable waste, geothermal and solar thermal.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the **longer-term trends**, the RES share more than doubled between 2005 and 2023. This was driven by dedicated policies and support schemes, as well as increased economic competitiveness of renewables. The increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% over the last decade (or 5.0% since 2005).\\\\n\\\\nModelling from the\\xa0[IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023)\\xa0and\\xa0[Ember](https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/fit-for-the-future-not-fit-for-55/)\\xa0indicate that reaching the **new minimum target** for 2030 of a 42.5% share of renewables might be feasible if fast and decisive action is taken to promote renewables and reduce energy consumption. The trends in the deployment of solar photovoltaics and heat pumps also provides optimism. However, reaching the target will require a challenging CAGR of 8% on the EU renewables share until 2030, which is more than double the observed rate over the past decade. Considering this, the EU is not likely to meet its target, unless it allocates more resources for a deep transformation of the energy system.\\\\n\\\\n### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#figure-2-share-of-energy-from-renewable-sources-by-country)Figure 2. Share of energy from renewable sources, by country\\\\n\\\\nSweden, Finland and Denmark had the highest RES shares among Member States in 2023 due to strong hydro industries (Sweden and Finland), wind power and wide use of solid biofuels for district heating. By contrast, Luxembourg and Belgium reported the lowest deployment of renewables, of 12% and 15% in 2023.\\\\n\\\\nOver time, Denmark, Sweden and Estonia have experienced the highest growth in RES shares, with more than 20 percentage points increase since 2005. Croatia, Slovenia and Romania, on the contrary, have seen an increase of less than nine percentage points between 2005 and 2023.\\\\n\\\\nOn a shorter timescale, 22 EU Member States saw an increase in their renewable energy shares between 2022 and 2023. Austria, Bulgaria and Finland topped the list, having increased their RES share by three percentage points or more in 2023. In contrast, the RES share of Latvia, Slovakia, Luxembourg and Poland decreased, compared to 2022.\\\\n\\\\nIn the European Economic Area, Norway and Iceland both have RES shares above 75%. The two countries generate most of their electricity from hydropower while, in Iceland, geothermal energy provides the majority of heating.\\\\n\\\\n### Supporting information\\\\n\\\\nDefinition\\\\n\\\\nThis indicator measures the EU’s progress towards achieving its 2020 and 2030 renewable energy targets. Gross final renewable energy consumption is the amount of renewable energy consumed for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport in the 27 EU Member States, and is expressed as a share of gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe [Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC)](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en) defines gross final energy consumption as the energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to final consumers (industry, transport, households, services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries), including the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch for electricity and heat production, and including losses of electricity and heat in transmission and distribution.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1 shows consumption of energy from renewable sources (including only certified biofuels complying with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria) as a proportion of gross final energy consumption and the recently adopted 2030 target.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2 shows the consumption of energy from renewable sources as a proportion of gross final energy consumption by country. It illustrates the progress made by the EU and its Member States in the last year.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information, please refer to the EEA\\'s\\xa0annual T[rends and projections in Europe,](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe) Eurostat’s page on [renewable energy statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Renewable_energy_statistics), and the Commission’s [Energy Union reports](https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-strategy/energy-union_en) and [Climate Action Progress reports](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/progress-climate-action_en#climate-action-progress-report).\\\\n\\\\nMethodology\\\\n\\\\n**Eurostat data**\\\\n\\\\nThe renewable energy share data used for 2005-2023 were taken directly from the Eurostat SHARES tool. The SHARES tool focuses on the harmonised calculation of the share of energy consumption from renewable sources among the 27 EU Member States. This is done in accordance with the RED guidelines and is based on national energy data reported to Eurostat. The Shares tool detailed results and manual are available online: ([https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database/additional-data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database/additional-data)).\\\\n\\\\nElectricity generation from hydropower and wind power must be normalised to smooth the effect of weather-related variations. In the case of hydropower, the normalisation is based on the ratio of electricity generation to the installed capacity averaged over 15 years; in the case of wind power, a similar normalisation formula is applied over five years. The Shares tool takes into account all biofuels consumed in transport between 2005 and 2010, and only biofuels certified as being in compliance with the RED sustainability criteria for the years starting from 2011.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to the calculation of the gross final energy consumption for Cyprus and Malta, the derogation in RED was used. This derogation allows these countries to consider the amount of energy consumed in aviation, as a proportion of their gross final energy consumption, to be no more than 4.12%.\\\\n\\\\nThe discussion on individual renewable energy sources was based on Eurostat energy balances, since the SHARES tool focus on sectors, rather than individual sources. The comparison is made based on their primary energy supply.\\\\n\\\\n**Proxy data**\\\\n\\\\nValues for 2005-2023 are compiled by Eurostat and reported by Member States. An update of this indicator with EEA estimates for the previous year takes place every autumn.\\\\n\\\\n**Targets**\\\\n\\\\nThe 2030 target presented in this indicator was adopted in October 2023 and is defined as a share of renewable energy in the EU’s gross final energy consumption of 42.5% by 2030 with an additional “aspirational” 2.5% indicative top up that would allow to reach 45%.\\\\n\\\\nPolicy/environmental relevance\\\\n\\\\nThis indicator is a headline indicator for monitoring progress towards achieving the aims of the [Eighth Environment Action Programme (8th EAP)](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/environment-action-programme-2030_en). It contributes mainly to monitoring progress towards sustainable energy aspects of Article 2.f of the 8th EAP which requires: ‘promoting environmental aspects of sustainability and significantly reducing key environmental and climate pressures related to the Union’s production and consumption, in particular in the areas of energy, industry, buildings and infrastructure, mobility, tourism, international trade and the food system’ . The European Commission Communication on the 8th\\xa0EAP monitoring framework specifies that this indicator should monitor the achievement by 2030 of the EU target of 42.5% renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption.\\\\n\\\\nThe RED (2009/28/EC) and its recast directive RED II (2018/2001/EU) establish an overall policy for the production of energy from renewable sources and the promotion of its use in the EU. The RED III was adopted in 2023, introducing stronger measures and a new 2030 target for renewables, aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\\\\n\\\\nAchieving the 2030 target will depend on the fast implementation of the reinforced policy and legal framework in the Member States, especially via speeding up permitting procedures, better visibility of auctions for renewables and a better integration of the different sectors. Implementation needs to be accompanied by accelerated grid developments in order to absorb more renewables and the full implementation of a guarantee-of-origin system with energy purchase agreements to allow further development of the renewable consumer market. In addition, better and more integrated planning will be required to ensure not only a high efficiency of investment and an accelerated pace of development, but also that the market penetration of these renewable sources takes into account other policy objectives such as environment protection.\\\\n\\\\nThe share of renewable energy consumption in final energy consumption is a broad indicator of progress towards reducing the impact of energy consumption on the environment (i.e., through decreased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant emissions). At the same time, impacts of increasing renewable energy consumption on landscapes, habitats and ecosystems, namely from construction, the use of water, the use of fertilisers and pesticides for biomass and biofuel crops, and the extraction of heavy metals for photovoltaic cells must also be considered.\\\\n\\\\nReplacing fossil fuels with renewables results in lower carbon emissions. However, total carbon emissions are not necessarily determined by the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption, but by the total amount of energy consumed from fossil sources.\\\\n\\\\nAccuracy and uncertainties\\\\n\\\\n#### [](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#methodology-uncertainty)Methodology uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nOfficially reported renewable energy data were compiled by Eurostat using annual joint questionnaires, which are shared by Eurostat and the International Energy Agency, following a well-established and harmonised methodology. Methodological information on the annual joint questionnaires and data compilation can be found on\\xa0[Eurostat\\'s web page on metadata on energy statistics](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy).\\\\n\\\\nValues concerning the prevoius year, which normally are published by EEA during the autumn, are approximate (proxies) and have been estimated by the EEA. These proxies were not obtained following the formal collection process for official statistics and are therefore less accurate and reliable than official statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**Notes on uncertainties in the underlying statistics and methodology:**\\\\n\\\\nBiomass and bio-waste, as defined by Eurostat, cover organic, non-fossil material of biological origin, which may be used for heat production or electricity generation. They comprise wood and wood waste, biogas, municipal solid waste (MSW) and biofuels. MSW comprises biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes produced by different sectors. Non-biodegradable municipal and solid wastes are not considered renewable, but current data availability does not allow the non-biodegradable content of wastes to be identified separately, except in industry. Large data-gaps also exist regarding the [energy use of wood](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/environmental-sustainability-energy-generation-forest-biomass-2021-01-26_en), which further adds to the methodological uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nThe electricity produced from hydropower storage systems is not classified as a renewable source of energy in terms of electricity production, but is considered part of the gross electricity consumption of a country. Hydropower and wind power generation are calculated as actual generation and normalised generation. Normalised generation is calculated using the weighted average load factor over the last 15 years for hydropower and the last five years for wind power.\\\\n\\\\nThe indicator measures the consumption of energy from renewable sources relative to total energy consumption for a particular country. The share of renewable energy could increase even if actual energy consumption from renewable sources falls. Similarly, the share could fall despite an increase in energy consumption from renewable sources.\\\\n\\\\nElectricity consumption within a national territory includes imports of electricity from neighbouring countries. It excludes electricity produced nationally but exported abroad. In some countries, the contribution of electricity trade to total electricity consumption and the changes observed from year to year need to be looked at carefully when analysing trends in electricity from RESs. Impacts on the (national) environment are also affected, since emissions are taken into account for the country in which the electricity is produced, whereas consumption is taken into account for the country in which the electricity is consumed.\\\\n\\\\n#### Data sets uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nNo uncertainty has been specified.\\\\n\\\\n#### Rationale uncertainty\\\\n\\\\nNo uncertainty has been specified.\\\\n\\\\nData sources and providers\\\\n\\\\n*   [Share of energy from renewable sources \\\\\\\\[NRG\\\\\\\\_IND\\\\\\\\_REN\\\\\\\\]](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NRG_IND_REN/default/table?lang=en), Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT)\\\\n    \\\\n*   [Approximated estimates for the share of gross final consumption of renewable energy sources in 2023 (EEA 2023 RES share proxies)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/1fd08152-1371-4274-8091-b50467738376), European Environment Agency (EEA)\\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n### Metadata\\\\n\\\\nDPSIRResponseTopics\\\\n\\\\n[Energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Energy&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\n[Renewable energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Renewable%20energy&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\n[Climate change mitigation](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?filters[0][field]=topic&filters[0][values][0]=Climate%20change%20mitigation&filters[0][type]=any&filters[1][field]=language&filters[1][type]=any&filters[1][values][0]=en&filters[2][field]=issued.date&filters[2][values][0]=Last%205%20years&filters[2][type]=any&sort-field=issued.date&sort-direction=desc)\\\\n\\\\nTags\\\\n\\\\n[renewable energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=renewable%20energy)\\\\n\\\\n[Energy](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=Energy)\\\\n\\\\n[8th EAP](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=8th%20EAP)\\\\n\\\\n[ENER028](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/advanced-search?q=ENER028)\\\\n\\\\nTemporal coverage\\\\n\\\\n2005-2030\\\\n\\\\nGeographic coverage\\\\n\\\\n*   Austria\\\\n*   Belgium\\\\n*   Bulgaria\\\\n*   Croatia\\\\n*   Cyprus\\\\n*   Czechia\\\\n*   Denmark\\\\n*   Estonia\\\\n*   Finland\\\\n*   France\\\\n*   Germany\\\\n*   Greece\\\\n*   Hungary\\\\n*   Iceland\\\\n*   Ireland\\\\n*   Italy\\\\n*   Latvia\\\\n*   Lithuania\\\\n*   Luxembourg\\\\n*   Malta\\\\n*   Netherlands\\\\n*   Norway\\\\n*   Poland\\\\n*   Portugal\\\\n*   Romania\\\\n*   Slovakia\\\\n*   Slovenia\\\\n*   Spain\\\\n*   Sweden\\\\n\\\\nTypologyPolicy-effectiveness indicator (Type D)UN SDGsSDG7: Affordable and clean energy, SDG13: Climate actionUnit of measure\\\\n\\\\nShare of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption (%);\\\\n\\\\nShare of energy from renewable sources (%)\\\\n\\\\nFrequency of disseminationOnce a year\\\\n\\\\n### References and footnotes\\\\n\\\\n1.

The conflict and resulting sanctions have raised concerns regarding energy security and energy costs that have put extremely high financial pressure on consumers and businesses.\\\\nIn response, the European Commission announced its REPowerEU strategy in March 2022 with the goal of reducing Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and entirely by 2030. The strategy focuses on three key topics, Securing non-Russian supplies of oil and gas Expanding the use of renewable energy Improving energy efficiency If the proposal is adopted, the European Union’s 2030 target for renewables would increase from the current 32% to 45% of the energy mix. The REPowerEU plan would bring total renewable energy generation capacity to 1,236 GW by 2030 (including 600 GW solar PV and 510 GW wind), 15% higher than the 1,067 GW envisaged under Fit for 55.\\\\nSource: IRENA,2022 Global trends in Solar Power 18 Box 1 Policy and Regulatory Trends As in 2020, the power sector continued to receive the renewable energy policy attention in 2021. Policies to support renewables in the power sector include: renewable portfolio standards (RPS), feed-in policies (tariffs and premiums), auctions and tenders, renewable energy certificates (RECs), net metering and other policies to encourage self-consumption, as well as fiscal and financial incentives (such as grants, rebates and tax credits).\\\\nThe major policy and regulatory trends to support solar energy deployment are described below, Key policies Description Feed-in Tariff (FIT)/ Feed in Premiums Policy ▪FITs and FIPs, are used to promote centralised and decentralised renewable power generation, and they remain among the most widely used policy mechanisms for supporting renewable power.\\\\n▪Ireland, which had removed its FIT in 2015, re-introduced it to boost citizen and community participation in the energy transition.\\\\n▪Trinidad and Tobago introduced a FIT to support solar PV rooftop systems.\\\\n▪India\\'s introduction of time-of-day (ToD) tariffs to incentivize solar power generation during peak demand periods.\\\\n▪Australia\\'s solar feed-in tariff (FIT) program is transitioning to competitive tenders, promoting cost-effective solar energy deployment. Developers now submit tariff proposals, and contracts are awarded to projects with the most competitive rates.\\\\nRenewable energy auctions or tenders ▪It is a competitive process to procure low cost Auctions for renewable energy offer a competitive way to buy cheap power from renewable sources. In 2021, a number of nations held national or subnational renewable energy auctions or tenders, as shown in the figure below: ▪Auction-based solar projects promote competition among developers, leading to cost reductions, increased efficiency, and better value for money.\\\\n▪It opens opportunities for price discovery, ensuring selection of the most economically competitive projects as well as lessens the subsidy burden on the government for deployment of large scale solar energy projects.\\\\n71 76 72 81 82 85 85 84 83 83 92 36 46 55 60 64 73 83 98 109 116 131 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Number of countries Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariffs and Tenders Feed-in tariff / premium payment Tendering Source: REN21, 2022 4.2 Global trends in Solar Power 19 Key policies Description Net metering ▪Net metering continued to be a popular policy instrument to support renewable energy i.e. for rooftop solar segment ▪Net metering is a regulated arrangement in which electricity generators can receive credits for excess generation, which can be applied to offset consumption in other billing periods. Under net metering, customers receive credit at the level of retail electricity price.\\\\n▪In India, Kerala introduced a new net metering rooftop programme with a goal of installing solar panels on 75,000 homes and West Bengal introduced net metering for household rooftop solar PV between 1 kW and 5 kW.\\\\n▪Malaysia introduced a new programme that allows residential customers to export surplus solar generation to the grid.\\\\nFinancial/ fiscal policies (grants, rebates and tax credits) ▪At a global level, approximately 17 countries introduced new financial or fiscal policies in 2021, including Denmark, France, Italy, Australia and New Zealand.\\\\n▪In Europe, Croatia implemented an USD 8.4 bn rebate programme for rooftop solar PV installations for businesses and households.\\\\n▪Sweden made available USD 28.7 Mn in rebates for households who install solar PV.\\\\nRenewable portfolio standards (RPS) ▪RPS mandates requiring utility to install/ use a certain share of renewable energy.\\\\n▪As of 2021, 31 US states and the District of Columbia had legally binding RPS.\\\\n▪Colombia introduced an obligation for utilities operating in the wholesale energy market to ensure that 10% of the electricity they distribute is generated by renewable technologies as of 2022.\\\\nRenewable energy certificate (REC) A certificate awarded to certify the generation of renewable energy (typically 1 MWh of electricity). RECs are preferred instrument to meet renewable energy obligations.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 20 Key Solar Policies in ISA Member Countries S No Countries FIT RPS REC Africa 1 Algeria 2 Benin 3 Botswana 4 Burkina Faso 5 Burundi 6 Cameroon 7 Cape Verde 8 Chad 9 Comoros 10 DR Congo 11 Cote d\\'Ivoire 12 Djibouti 13 Egypt 14 Equatorial Guinea 15 Eritrea 16 Ethiopia 17 Gabon 18 Gambia 19 Ghana 20 Guinea 21 Guinea-Bissau 22 Liberia 23 Madagascar 24 Malawi 25 Mali 26 Mauritius 27 Morocco 28 Mozambique 29 Namibia 30 Niger 31 Nigeria 32 Rwanda S No Countries FIT RPS REC 33 Sao Tome Principe 34 Senegal 35 Seychelles 36 Somalia 37 South Sudan 38 Sudan 39 Tanzania 40 Togolese Republic 41 Tunisia 42 Uganda 43 Zambia 44 Zimbabwe Asia-Pacific 45 Australia 46 Bahrain 47 Bangladesh 48 Cambodia 49 Fiji 50 India 51 Japan 52 Kiribati 53 Maldives 54 Marshall islands 55 Myanmar 56 Nauru 57 Nepal 58 Oman 59 Palau 60 Papua New Guinea 61 Samoa 62 Saudi Arabia 63 Sri Lanka 64 Syria 65 Tonga Existing policies /schemes Absence of policies/schemes Note: FIT - Feed-in Tariff; RPS - Renewable portfolio standards; REC - Renewable Energy Certificate Global trends in Solar Power 21 Key Solar Policies in ISA Member Countries S No Countries FIT RPS REC 66 Tuvalu 67 United Arab Emirates 68 Vanuatu 69 Yemen Europe & others 70 Denmark 71 France 72 Germany 73 Greece 74 Hungary 75 Israel 76 Italy 77 Luxembourg 78 Netherlands 79 Norway 80 Sweden 81 UK 82 USA Latin America & Caribbean 83 Antigua and Barbuda 84 Argentina 85 Barbados 86 Belize S No Countries FIT RPS REC 87 Bolivia 88 Brazil 89 Chile 90 Costa Rica 91 Cuba 92 Dominica 93 Dominican Republic 94 El Salvador 95 Grenada 96 Guyana 97 Haiti 98 Jamaica 99 Nicaragua 100 Paraguay 101 Peru 102 Saint Kitts and Nevis 103 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 104 Saint Lucia 105 Suriname 106 Trinidad and Tobago 107 Venezuela Major Policy gaps and Challenges 1. Facilitate permitting for utility-scale systems - Lengthy and complicated permitting processes are one of the major challenges to the faster deployment of utility-scale solar PV plants in many parts of the world, especially in Europe. Developing clear rules and pathways for developers applying for a construction permit, determining strict timeframes for application processing, and public engagement in the identification of land suitable for investment could significantly accelerate solar PV deployment.\\\\n2. Establish a balanced policy environment for distributed PV - Appropriate policies are needed to attract investment into distributed solar PV while also securing sufficient revenue to pay for fixed network assets and ensuring that the cost burden is allocated fairly among all consumers.\\\\nExisting policies /schemes Absence of policies/schemes Note: FIT - Feed-in Tariff; RPS - Renewable portfolio standards; REC - Renewable Energy Certificate; Source: REN21, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 22 A Renewable Policy Transition in China China has shifted its renewable energy pricing policy from a premium FIT model to a “grid parity” model where renewable and coal plants sell electricity at the same price. The National Energy Administration stopped approving FITs for renewable energy projects in 2018, which was followed by a decision to phase out FIT schemes. The move was driven by delay in FIT payments and by the plunging cost of PV modules.\\\\nThe policy transition resulted annual solar PV installations to fall approximately 30% in 2019. However, as prosumers sought to benefit from the final years of FIT, the market grew 60% in 2020, to reach 55 GW of new installations in 2021.\\\\nIn 2021, China announced its 14th Five-Year-Plan, puts a continued focus on wind and solar PV power as well as energy integration and energy storage, aiming for a 20% non-fossil fuel share in the energy mix by 2025. China’s recently announced targets for carbon neutrality by 2060 have also driven demand for renewables.\\\\nSource: REN21, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 23 Fossil Fuel Subsidies are back on the rise – Global Scenario According to IEA, energy subsidies have been rising since 2021 after a noticeable dip in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. In 2021, rebounding fossil fuel prices and energy had already lifted fossil fuel consumption subsidies to USD 532 billion, around 20% above 2019’s pre-pandemic levels.\\\\nAt a global level, Russia was the largest single provider of fossil fuel subsidy payments, followed by Iran and China in 2021. According to the IEA, subsidies for the use of fossil fuels increased to more than USD 1 Tn in 2022, by far the highest yearly value ever recorded.\\\\nIn 2022, the cost of fossil fuels experienced significant fluctuations and reached exceptionally high levels due to geopolitical tensions affecting energy markets. Various policy measures were implemented to shield consumers from skyrocketing prices. However, these interventions had an unintended consequence of maintaining the artificial competitiveness of fossil fuels compared to low-emission alternatives.\\\\nSource: IEA, 2022 Box 3 Box 2 ▪Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is a crucial element for successful clean energy transitions, as highlighted in the Glasgow Climate Pact.\\\\n▪Fossil fuel consumption is subsidized due to end-user prices being high enough to cover the market value of the fuel.\\\\n▪During an energy crisis, governments prioritize shielding consumers from price impacts rather than committing to phasing out subsidies.\\\\n▪This approach led to a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption subsidies in 2022 and the implementation of measures to mitigate the impact on energy bills.\\\\n▪While this provided temporary relief, it reduced the incentive for consumers to save or transition to cleaner energy sources, thus delaying a sustainable resolution of the crisis.\\\\n▪Moreover, these subsidies depleted public funds that could have been allocated to other areas, including clean energy transitions.\\\\n30,808 26,949 27,208 40,601 33,624 29,593 47,449 63,908 43,294 47,940 40,253 32,688 20,600 40,938 15,883 13,401 30,869 37,684 21,792 10,383 27,042 11,441 6,695 8,764 16,097 12,979 9,340 23,577 9,612 6,976 13,428 17,642 11,845 5,209 21,002 11,938 9,235 8,394 8,589 6,303 4,825 17,469 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 200000 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Million USD Fossil Fuel Subsidies in ISA Member Countries India Saudi Arabia Egypt Algeria Venezuela United Arab Emirates Source: IEA, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 24 Solar PV Technology Trends Taking advantage of the growing solar PV capacity across the globe, several countries are underway to stimulate future market growth, exploring innovative solar technologies from bifacial solar cells and floating solar farms to the energy harvesting trees. The major developments are as follows.\\\\nTechnologies Description Bifacial solar cells ▪Key features: Bifacial solar panels can generate up to 30% more energy than monofacial panels. Bifacial modules have also lower Balance of Systems (BOS) costs as fewer modules are needed to produce the same amount of energy as traditional modules.\\\\n▪Worldwide demand of bifacial modules has also raised, with countries such as the United States, Brazil and the United\\u2006Kingdom increasingly use these modules for utility scale Photovoltaic plants.\\\\n▪Based on the present market trend, bifacial solar modules are extending their geographical reach from Japan, Europe to the emerging markets across the globe. Bifacial solar modules have attracted a lot of market attention in the recent years.\\\\n▪The International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) predicts that after having a minimal presence in 2017, the bifacial concept is expected to capture approximately 10% of the market share in 2018, increase to 15% by 2020, and potentially reach 40% within the next decade (IRENA, 2019).\\\\nSolar trees ▪In solar tree, the solar modules are planted on a single pillar, which resembles like a tree trunk. Solar tree serves the dual purpose of being an energy generator as well as an artwork.\\\\n▪Solar trees serve as a complementary option to rooftop solar, offering ergonomic advantages over traditional solar panels. They require around 100 times less space compared to horizontal solar plants while generating an equivalent amount of electricity.\\\\nThis makes solar trees a viable solution for economies facing challenges of limited land and space availability.\\\\n4.3 Global trends in Solar Power 25 The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI) residential colony in Durgapur is now home to the world\\'s largest solar tree, developed by CSIR-CMERI. With an installed capacity of 11.5 kW, this solar tree can generate an annual clean power output of approximately 12,000-14,000 units.\\\\nThe design of the solar tree ensures maximum sunlight exposure for each of its approximately 35 solar PV panels, minimizing shadow areas below. Unlike rooftop solar facilities, the solar tree\\'s arms holding the panels are flexible and adjustable according to specific needs, providing an additional advantage.\\\\nSource: CSIR-CMERI Website India develops World’s largest Solar Tree Box 4 Technology Description Solar carports ▪Solar carports are ground-mounted solar panels that are installed in the vehicle parking lots. Home driveways can also be laid underneath to form a carport.\\\\n▪Solar Carports are very popular alternative and supplement to the classic rooftop systems, with the benefit that the solar carports can be installed entirely independent of the roof angle, shape and orientation of the house.\\\\n▪Besides providing the shade to the vehicles parked underneath, they can efficiently generate electricity and offers a number of benefits. If solar carports are coupled with a well-designed charging system, the electricity produced can be used for EV charging thus reducing the costs of running the vehicle.\\\\n▪An elevated solar carport track the sun throughout the day, can generate 50-70% more energy than fixed solar carport systems of similar size and they are becoming a strong and attractive economic proposition in a growing number of markets.\\\\n▪Finally, space saving is another important aspect, as carports make better utilisation of land which is already in use for the vehicle parking rather than using an open land.\\\\nThe energy generation data from the solar tree can be monitored either real-time/ on daily basis. The Solar Tree can also have certain customizable features for application at diverse sites. The Solar Trees are designed in a manner to ensure minimum Shadow Area, thus potentially making it available for widespread usage in the agricultural activities such as, e-Tractors and e-Power Tillers and High Capacity Pumps.\\\\nSolar Trees can be aligned with Agriculture for substituting price-volatile fossil fuels. Each Solar Tree has the potential to save 10-12 tonnes of CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere as GHG when compared with fossil fuel fired energy generation.\\\\nBesides, the surplus generated power can be incorporated into the energy grid. This Agricultural Model can provide a constant economic return and support the farmers to counter the effects of the uncertain variation in agriculture related activities, thus creating farming an Economic & Energy Sustainable practice.\\\\nThe solar tree has the capability to include IOT based features, i.e. round-the-clock CCTV surveillance in agricultural fields, wind speed, rainfall prediction, real-time humidity, and soil analytics sensors.\\\\nSource: Ministry of Science and Technology (India),2016 Tata Motors and Tata Power inaugurate India’s largest Solar Carport at its Car Plant in Pune Tata Motors and Tata Power jointly inaugurated India’s largest grid-synchronized solar carport at the Tata Motors car plant in Chikhali, Pune. The 6.2 MW solar carport deployed by Tata Power will generate 86.4 lakh kWh of electricity per year and is estimated to decrease 7,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually and 1.6 lakh tonnes over its lifecycle.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 26 Box 5 Technology Description Floating solar farms/ floatovoltaics ▪Floatovoltaics refer to the photovoltaic solar power systems that float on dams, reservoirs and other water bodies.\\\\n▪These floating photovoltaic panels generate large amount of electricity, and the best part is, that they don’t use any space on real estate/ land.\\\\n▪Due to the cooling effect of water, these floating solar cells generate more power by up to 10%. However, floating solar PV also faces some challenges such as feasible site selection, rusting due to moisture and high cost as compared to conventional solar plants.\\\\n▪Besides producing electricity, these ‘floatovoltaics’ are also beneficial in water management by reducing water loss due to evaporation.\\\\nSpanning over to 30,000 square meters, the solar carport will not only generate green power, but will also provide covered parking for cars in the plant.\\\\nAlso, Tata Power Solar commissioned solar carport with 2.67 MW of capacity at Cochin International Airport. The project comprised of 8,472 solar panels on 27 carports spread over 20,289 square meter of area. Benefits: Offsets 1,868 tonnes of CO2 at Cochin International Airport per annum, equivalent to 46,700 tonnes of CO2 offset in 25 years. The plant generates 11,000 units of electricity daily.\\\\nSource: Tata Power Website Hybrid Hydropower and Floating Solar PV systems in China The development of the grid connected hybrid systems that combine floating solar photovoltaic and hydropower technologies is still at an early stage. Only a small system of 218 kWp has been deployed in Portugal.\\\\nIn 1989, the Longyangxia hydropower plant was commissioned with the four turbines of 320 MW each 1,280 MW in total. It serves as the frequency regulation and major load peaking power plant in China’s northwest power grid.\\\\nThe associated Gonghe solar plant is 30 kms away from the Longyangxia hydropower plant. The initial phase was built & commissioned in 2013 with a nameplate capacity of 320 MW.\\\\nAn additional 530 MWp was completed in 2015. The Photovoltaic plant is directly connected through a reserved 330 kV transmission line to the hydropower substation.\\\\nThe hybrid system is operated so that the energy generation of the hydro and Floating Solar Photovoltaic components complement each other. After the solar Photovoltaic was included, the grid operator began to issue a higher power dispatch set point during the day.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 27 Box 6 Technology Description Agrophotovoltaic (APV) As expected, on a typical day the output from the hydro facility is now decreased, especially from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., when solar Photovoltaic generation is high.\\\\nThe saved energy is requested by the operator to be utilised during the early morning and late night hours. Although the daily generation pattern of the hydropower has varied, the daily reservoir water balance could be maintained at the same level as before to meet the water requirements of the other downstream reservoirs.\\\\nAll power produced by the hybrid system is fully absorbed by the grid, without any reduction. This system shows that hydro turbines can provide adequate response to demand.\\\\nSource: World Bank, 2018 Global trends in Solar Power 28 Fiji Agrophotovoltaic Project in Ovalau In order to reduce Fiji’s reliance on hydropower, the electricity output is becoming increasingly volatile owing to irregular annual rainfall, this project aims to develop a 4 MW solar PV power generation system that will boost local agricultural production, and to combine it with a 5 MW battery storage system. The total project value is USD 10 million, including Green climate fund’s loan of USD 3.9 Mn and a USD 1.1 Mn grant.\\\\nSource: IRENA,2022 Box 7 ▪APV technology aligns with sustainable agriculture practices by utilizing land efficiently and promoting renewable energy generation in rural areas.\\\\n▪APV systems can help farmers diversify income streams by generating electricity and potentially accessing additional revenue streams through renewable energy incentives.\\\\n▪Research efforts are focused on understanding the agronomic impacts of APV systems, exploring compatible crop combinations, and assessing the long-term sustainability of this integrated approach.\\\\nThe \\\\\"Agrophotovoltaics – Resource-Efficient Land Use (APV-RESOLA)\\\\\" project, situated in Germany near Lake Constance, has successfully demonstrated the APV concept. The project involved a 194 kW solar system mounted on a 5-meter-high structure above land used for cultivating celery, clover, potatoes, and winter wheat. The findings confirmed earlier research, with land use efficiency reaching 160% in 2017 and 186% in 2018 (IRENA, 2019).\\\\nItaly included USD 1.24 Bn in support for agrovoltaics in its post-COVID recovery plan.\\\\nFarmers are beginning to gain wider awareness of the benefits of agricultural PV – including higher crop yields.\\\\nTechnology Description Solar energy storage Solar energy storage systems stores solar energy during the day to utilise at night/ during periods of low sunlight, reducing the need for grid electricity.\\\\nThere are several benefits of solar storage, including storing excess energy for use during periods of high demand, reducing reliance on the grid, and providing backup power in case of an outage.\\\\nBuilding-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) Building-integrated photovoltaics are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof, skylights, or facades. BIPV serves dual-purpose: they serve as both the outer layer of a structure and generate electricity for on-site use or export to the grid.\\\\nThe key benefits are : ▪ No unoccupied area required ▪ Decreased heat-transmittance ▪Decreased harmful irradiance Some of the constraints include: ▪ Higher capital cost for installation ▪ Difficult and expensive to retrofit older buildings ▪More complex and requires high labour charges than normal PV modules installation Global trends in Solar Power 29 Maryland, U.S - Solar and Battery Storage for Customer and Ancillary Services Solar Grid Storage LLC provided 500 kW AC storage comprising about 300 kWh of lithium-ion batteries and inverter combination to the headquarters of Konterra in Maryland. The storage and inverter system are connected to the solar PV panels with 400 kW capacity.\\\\nThe key objective of the Solar Grid Storage LLC is to provide both the customer and the grid with multiple benefits. This includes fast-power balancing support to the local grid, backup emergency power during grid outages and reduced system cost.\\\\nThe battery storage systems are connected to the local utility and can thus provide a range of ancillary services when required by the utility or grid operator through normal dispatch. Solar Grid Storage LLC’s standard service is to provide the inverter and storage system at a very low cost.\\\\nSolar Grid recovers these costs plus a profit margin through ancillary services provided to the grid and paid by the grid operator. Thus, Solar Grid Storage LLC business model effectively utilises solar battery storage to capitalise on the regulatory markets for ancillary services in the United States.\\\\nSource: IRENA, 2022 Box 8 Solar Supply Chain Trends This section focuses on the trends in the solar PV supply chain, bottlenecks and measures to build a more secure supply chain. For the solar PV technology, the main segments of the value chain include manufacturing of equipment, construction and installation, and O&M, plus a range of support services, enabling functions and governance aspects.\\\\nManufacturing Construction and Installation Operation and Maintenance Solar Supply Chain - Overview Source: IRENA, 2022 The solar PV manufacturing capacity shifted from Europe, the United States to China over the last decade. In 2022, China dominates the global solar PV supply chains. The global manufacturing capacity of solar PV jumped from approximately 25 GW (2010) to 220 GW (2022), with China accounting for 97% of the production. In addition, 300 GW of manufacturing capabilities have already been announced, underlying the willingness to prevent other actors from gaining significant shares of the market.\\\\nThe Chinese market dominance reflects the ability of local companies to gain benefit from the economies of scale, and the government support which has set strategic long-term goals in the industry.\\\\nBetween 2017 and 2021, around half of the total Chinese production of PV modules has been delivered to Asia-Pacific regions and India while the other half delivered to Europe, with smaller amounts directed to Latin America and Caribbean and the rest of the world.\\\\n4.4 Global trends in Solar Power 30 Key determinants of solar supply chain Raw material availability Manufacturing capacity and technology Market demand and growth Price and cost dynamics Innovation and research and development Trade policies and regulations The skewed geographical concentration in solar PV supply chain has led the European Union, India and the United States to introduce policy incentives to support domestic solar PV production. However, diversifying solar PV manufacturing will be possible only if the production costs reduce to ensure competitiveness with the lowest- cost producers (like China) in both short and long term.\\\\nChina has infrastructure and industrial policies that built an integrated supply chain with large economies of scale. Low labour cost is also a key enabler. China’s industrial policies focusing on solar PV have enabled economies of scale and enabled continuous innovation throughout the supply chain.\\\\nIn 2021, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia have become manufacturing and assembly hubs, together representing approximately 9% of cell and module production.

Approximately 72% of global polysilicon production takes place in China, with massive expansion of capacity under construction or planned.\\\\nKey Trends in Solar PV Manufacturing China India ▪The Indian government imposed import duties of 40% on all modules and 25% on all cells effective April 2022.\\\\n▪The country also introduced a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency modules. This offers financial support for project developers who commit to setting up production facilities along the supply chain.\\\\n▪In 2021, the rising costs in China had knock-on effect on module prices.\\\\nIndian PV imports sank to a low of approximately USD 500 Mn, down from almost USD 4 Bn in 2018.\\\\nUSA ▪The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August 2022, embraces elements of a broader industrial policy.\\\\n▪It includes manufacturing credits for clean energy, in addition to a long-term extension of existing solar and wind tax credits and many other climate and health provisions.\\\\n▪A clean manufacturing tax credit alone could trigger approximately 1,15,000 job-years (direct, indirect and induced jobs), and tax credits for solar, wind and battery manufacturing could create another 5,61,000 jobs.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 32 In the past year, rising global commodity prices have led to higher material costs for solar PV manufacturing. Today, China and ASEAN countries (Viet Nam, Thailand and Malaysia) have the lowest solar PV module manufacturing costs for all segments of the supply chain. Economies of scale, supply chain integration, relatively low energy costs and labour productivity make China the most competitive solar module manufacturer worldwide. Higher investment costs in India are the primary reason for the cost differential with China, while higher overhead and labour costs makes US PV manufacturing not as competitive.\\\\nIn Europe, rising energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine widened the cost gap with China. Today, EU industrial energy prices are more than triple those of China, India and the United States.\\\\nThe solar PV manufacturing supply chain is influenced by factors such as land, energy, capital, and labor.\\\\nHowever, government industrial policies play a critical role in shaping viable supply chains. Polysilicon production requires significant capital investments and skilled labor. Solar cell manufacturing relies on access to modern production equipment and skilled machine operators. Module production, focused on assembly, requires less technical skill compared to cell fabrication.\\\\nDiversifying solar PV supply chains requires addressing key challenges - The cost competitiveness of existing solar PV manufacturing is a key challenge to diversify supply chains. China is the most cost-competitive country to manufacture components of the solar PV supply chain. Costs in China are 20% lower than in the United States, 10% lower than in India and 35% lower than in Europe. Large variations in labour, and investment explain these variations. In the absence of manufacturing support and financial incentives, the bankability of manufacturing projects remains limited outside China and few countries in Southeast Asia.\\\\nLow-cost electricity is a key enabler for the competitiveness of the solar PV supply chain. Electricity accounts for over 40% of production costs for polysilicon and 20% for ingots/wafers. Solar panel manufacturers can also use their own renewable electricity on site, thereby reducing both electricity bills and emissions.\\\\nGovernment policies are vital to build a more secure solar PV supply chain - High commodity prices and supply chain bottlenecks resulted in the increase of 20% in solar panel prices over the last year. Globally, policies to support solar PV have focused mostly on increasing demand and lowering costs.\\\\nHowever, sustainable and resilient supply chains are needed to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of solar panels. Governments need to turn their attention to ensuring the security of solar PV supplies as an integral part of clean energy transition.\\\\nGlobal trends in Solar Power 33 Solar PV Cost Trends One of the key trends in the solar PV industry in 2023 is the continued decline in the cost of components required for solar panel installations, such as solar cells and inverters. This is due to the increased manufacturing efficiency, advances in technology and economies of scale. Manufacturers have become more efficient in their solar PV production processes, leading to produce solar panels at a much faster pace. Advances in technology have led to manufacturing of solar cells and inverters at a lower cost. The economies of scale have resulted in the cost-effective production of solar panels in larger quantities. The figure below depicts the key drivers involved in reducing the price of solar panels, Technology improvements that have reduced system losses have played a vital role. The recent adoption towards an increased use of bifacial modules has increased the performance of the solar panel by generating more energy (than mono-facial panels).\\\\nFurther, solar PV module prices return to the downward curve they were following prior to the covid-19 pandemic, as polysilicon supply becomes more abundant. The raw material and shipping costs decline in 2023 also has a direct impact on solar component prices.\\\\nAdvances in technology 1 Manufacturing efficiency 2 Economies of scale 3 Global trends in Solar Power 34 Key factors influencing price of Solar PV Modules Source: IEA, 2020 Solar PV Module Price Trend Key factors influencing price of Solar PV Modules \\uf0a7 Technological advancements: The continuous improvement in solar cell efficiency, manufacturing processes, and material utilization has led to cost reductions and increased module output, resulting in lower prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Scale of production: As the solar industry expanded and production volumes increased, economies of scale kicked in. Larger manufacturing capacities allowed for bulk purchasing of raw materials and equipment, reducing production costs, and driving down module prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Policies and incentives: Various policies, such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and subsidies, have played a significant role in driving demand for solar PV installations. These incentives have stimulated market growth, increased competition, and ultimately led to price reductions.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Reduction in manufacturing costs: Over time, manufacturers have optimized production processes, improved yield rates, and reduced manufacturing costs. Factors such as automation, economies of scale, and increased competition among manufacturers have contributed to cost savings and subsequently lower module prices.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Supply and demand dynamics: Fluctuations in supply and demand have influenced module prices. Increased demand has strained the supply chain at times, resulting in temporary price spikes. Conversely, oversupply situations have led to price declines.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Raw material prices: The prices of key raw materials used in solar PV modules, such as silicon, silver, and aluminium, have experienced fluctuations. Changes in these material costs can impact module prices, although technological advancements and manufacturing efficiencies have helped mitigate the impact.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Trade policies and tariffs: Trade policies, including import duties and tariffs, have affected the price of solar PV modules. Imposition of tariffs on module imports has disrupted the supply chain and increased prices in some instances.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Balance of system costs: The components beyond the module itself, such as inverters, mounting structures, and installation costs, it has an indirect impact on module prices. As the balance of system costs decreased due to technological advancements and market competition, it created downward pressure on overall system prices, including modules.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Research and development (R&D) investments: Investments in solar PV research and development have driven technological advancements and innovation. R&D initiatives have led to the discovery of new materials, manufacturing techniques, and cell designs, all of which have contributed to price reductions over time.\\\\n\\uf0a7 Global market dynamics: Changes in the global solar PV market, including the emergence of new markets, regional variations in demand, and geopolitical factors, have influenced module prices. Market dynamics impact the balance of supply and demand, which in turn affects prices.\\\\nUSD 0.2 per Watt Solar Market Trends The rise of increasingly cost-effective energy storage combined with greater demand-side flexibility and the expansion of transmission infrastructure is making it possible for regions to transition to fully renewable-based power systems. Another factor enabling the transition to solar-based energy systems is the improvement in the electricity access rates, especially in the off-grid areas. The figure below highlights the share of the population with access to electricity in 2020 across ISA Member Countries, Status of Access to Electricity (%) – ISA Member Countries 44% ≤ 0% 64% ≤ 45% 94% ≤ 65% 100% ≤ 95% By the end of 2020, 91%2 of the global population had access to electricity. In Asia & Pacific, access to electricity reached 92.9% in 2020, Europe and others (100%), Latin America (96.4%).\\\\nIn Africa, access to electricity rates almost tripled from approximately 8 Mn between 2000 and 2013 to 24 Mn people between 2014 and 2019.\\\\nThe population without electricity access, peaked at 613 Mn in 2013, declined progressively to 572 Mn in 2019. Much of this transition came from countries such as Kenya, Senegal, Rwanda, Ghana and Ethiopia, while more than 40% of Sub-Saharan African countries do not yet have official electricity access targets.\\\\nMost of the gap in electricity access can be attributed to the countries where population growth has outpaced the electrification rate, such as Burundi, Chad, Malawi and Democratic republic of Congo. These countries should effectively utilise the natural solar potential to improve the electricity access rates.

Solutions range from small-scale off-grid installations for unelectrified rural clinics, to larger, steady power delivery services for urban clinics that house crucial medical devices but are subject to unreliable grids. During the pandemic, there has been a particular focus on cold chains to keep COVID-19 vaccines chilled from production to delivery. These cold storage facilities require a 24/7 power supply, which has come from hybrid solar/diesel, battery/inverter systems or direct-drive solar refrigerators.\\\\nDuring 2020 and 2021, a variety of initiatives included mini grids and microgrids in the health sector: • Nigeria’s Rural Electrification Agency developed several solar mini-grids for use at hospitals and other healthcare facilities as an emergency response to COVID-19. Health facilities also were a focus of several other donor-driven mini-grid initiatives.\\\\n• Power Africa, funded by the US Agency for International Development, directed USD 4.1 million in grants to off grid companies in 2020 to electrify health clinics in rural and peri-urban areas through mini-grids.\\\\nSource: REN21,2022 Box 9 Solar PV for Electricity Access - Chad At a global level, Chad has one of the lowest electricity access rates.

The majority of 43,000 salt pan farmers utilise inefficient diesel powered water pumps for extracting brine from ground as part of salt harvesting process. The diesel accounts for a significant proportion of farmers production costs. In fact, farmers spend up to 40% of their annual revenue buying diesel for the next production season, thus reducing disposable income.\\\\nTwo pilot projects, carried out by the Self Employed Women’s Association, have demonstrated that powering pumps with solar energy can decrease production costs, increase reliability, efficiency and salt harvest outputs, resulting in the improved rural livelihoods.\\\\nAnnual savings for a farmer rose to INR 83,000 - a 161% raise when compared to those using diesel-powered pumps with additional benefits including reduced air pollution. Across the Kutch, replacing diesel water pumps with solar and hybrid solar/diesel ones could potentially reduce CO2 emissions by 115,000 tonnes.\\\\nThe multi-functional nature of solar panels also increases its value, particularly for the off-grid villages, enabling complementary uses such as powering the households. Interestingly, some salt traders - who usually loan salt-pan-worker money to purchase diesel for irrigation, have now acquired the solar pumps and are leasing them out to salt pan workers on an annual basis.\\\\nIn this manner, they are able to recover their investment in three years, while making the technology accessible for salt pan workers who now need not incur the capital costs of the system.\\\\nSource: NRDC, 2018 Reducing Production Costs using Solar Pumps: India Global trends in Solar Power 41 Box 13 Source: IRENA, 2021 Solar PV Investment Trends The annual investments in renewable energy continued a positive trend in 2022.

In the United States, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act – encompassing new tax credits, USD 30 Bn in grants and loans for clean energy generation and storage, and USD 60 Bn in support of manufacturing of low-carbon components – is expected to attract USD 114 Bn investment by 2031.\\\\nLatin America and Caribbean region attracted 4.9% of global investments in 2020, followed by Asia and Africa.\\\\nDuring 2018-2021, Latin America and Caribbean attracted USD 21 Mn, equivalent to less than 1.5% of cumulative commitments over that period.\\\\nThe region has electricity access rates of more than 90%. With smaller shares of the population living in off-grid locations, these regions represent relatively small markets for decentralised energy systems.\\\\nInvestment Trends in Vietnam and Thailand Vietnam’s rapid industrialisation has prompted a surge in energy demand. Much of this industrial growth has been fuelled by foreign direct investment, as companies look to diversify their supply chains away from China.\\\\nRooftop solar installations in industrial parks have grown to meet these companies requirement for renewable energy (and more climate-friendly products). The country has incentivised the growth of renewable energy generation via FiTs in the solar industry. Tariffs for onshore and offshore wind were made more generous in 2018 after poor initial uptake. Coal is still the primary source of electricity production in the country, though slow development of new plants led the government to pivot to solar (and later wind) along with gas to meet its rising energy needs (Government of Vietnam, 2016).\\\\nIn contrast, investment in neighbouring Thailand has been anaemic. This can be partly explained by differences in the two countries’ stages of economic growth, and energy mixes, among other factors. While endowed with similar natural resources, economic growth in the 1990s helped Thailand set up a well functioning and robust power supply. A subsequent decline in economic growth rates slowed energy demand significantly, and Thailand’s demand now lags that of its rapidly industrialising neighbour.\\\\nThailand’s Power Development Plan aims for a 10 GW expansion in solar PV capacity by 2037, whereas Vietnam has targeted an additional 18 GW of solar PV capacity by 2030 and another 18 GW from wind power.\\\\nWith renewable energy growth in Thailand remaining tepid for the foreseeable future, private energy giants such as Super Energy Corp have been increasingly turning to foreign markets, including Vietnam, to fuel growth.\\\\nBoth Vietnam and Thailand have used generous FiTs to help grow the supply of renewable energy. However, Vietnam’s high energy demand and ambitious renewable energy targets have made FiTs a more effective policy tool.\\\\nSource: IRENA, 2023 Box 14 Global trends in Solar Power 44 Solar PV Employment Trends The renewable energy sector employed 12.7 Mn people, directly and indirectly, in 2021. About two-thirds of all jobs are in Asia, and China accounts for 42% of the global total. It is followed by the European Union and Brazil with 10% each, and the United States and India with 7% each. The number continued to grow worldwide over the past decade, with most jobs in the solar PV, bioenergy, hydropower and wind power industries. In 2021, solar PV employed 4.3 Mn jobs, the fastest-growing sector, accounting for more than a third of the total renewable energy workforce.

At a Global level, China accounted for about 2.7 Mn jobs (i.e. 63% of PV employment worldwide). Asia Pacific countries host 79% of the world’s PV jobs, reflecting the region’s continued dominance of manufacturing and strong presence in installations. The remaining jobs were in the Americas (7.7% of all jobs), Europe (6.8%) and the rest of the world (4.9%)4.\\\\nSolar PV Employment in 2021: ISA Member Countries 4 IRENA, 2022 Global trends in Solar Power 46 Renewable Energy Employment landscape in Vietnam & Australia Vietnam is a major manufacturer, exporter and installer of PV cells and modules. Solar cell production rose from just 37 MW in 2014 to 3.75 GW; module output increased from 1.2 GW to 8.5 GW in 2021 (Wood Mackenzie, 2022a). The breakneck expansion of domestic solar installations, triggered by high FITs, brought total capacity from 105 MW in 2018 to 17 GW in 2020.\\\\nAs a result, the country’s electricity grid became severely overloaded, leading to curtailments. Despite some grid improvements, the domestic solar PV expansion came to an abrupt halt in 2021, and emphasis shifted to off-grid rooftop deployment.\\\\nThe unprecedented installations in 2020 resulted in significant economic activity and job creation. More than a hundred new installation companies were set up in south-central Ninh Thuan province, which was home to around 2.5 GW of installations in 2021.\\\\nAs installations shot up, Vietnam’s solar PV workforce rose to 1,26,300 jobs in 2020. In 2021, the lack of installations apart from the rooftop additions has resulted in reduction of the workforce.\\\\nIn the Pacific, Australia completed some of its largest solar projects in 2021, according to the Clean Energy Council (2022). New capacity additions included 3.3 GW of small-scale solar and 1.2 GW of large-scale solar.\\\\nThe Clean Energy Council reports another 9.3 GW worth of renewable energy projects under construction or financially committed at the end of 2021, representing over 35,000 jobs, including almost 21,000 in New South Wales. Meanwhile, the federal government’s bioenergy roadmap created some 26,200 full-time jobs. The government committed about AUD 464 Mn to the construction of seven regional hydrogen hubs, which might create 1,30,000 jobs by 2030 (Clean Energy Council, 2022).\\\\nSource: IRENA,2022 Global trends in Solar Power 47 Box 15 Solar & Equity 5 Solar & Gender Equity The inclusion of women in renewable energy weaves together SDG 5 on gender equality and women’s empowerment whereas SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy. Gender equity refers to ‘the provision of fairness and justice in distribution of benefits and responsibilities between women and men’.\\\\nThe energy industry has long been known for its male-dominated culture and unequal opportunities for women’s career advancement.\\\\nAt a Global scenario, the share of women working full time in the solar PV industry is 40%, the highest share of any renewable energy sub-sector.\\\\n40% 21% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Solar PV Wind Women in Wind & Solar PV industry, 2021 Most women in solar PV hold administrative jobs (58%), followed by non-STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) technical positions (38%). It is well reported that across the economy, in policy making and governance, women’s presence on company boards and in senior management positions is low. According to IRENA’s solar PV survey, women hold barely 30% of managerial jobs and 17% of senior management positions, faring better in solar PV compared to the wind power.\\\\n58% 38% 35% 32% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Administration Non-STEM technical Other Non-technical STEM Women in Solar PV workforce 2021, by role 30% 17% 13% 8% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% Management Senior management Women in Management positions in Solar PV and Wind energy, 2021 Solar PV Wind Source: IRENA, 2022 Source: IRENA, 2022 5 Global trends in Solar Power 49 Therefore, while women are better represented in solar PV management than in other technologies and sectors, substantial efforts are needed to enable greater participation of women at all levels and to expand the skills and talents needed to drive the transformation.\\\\nWomen’s share of solar PV employment is smaller in Europe and others, Latin America and the Caribbean than in the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions.

To expedite this initiative, MNRE has established an empowered committee consisting of government officials, experts, and industry associations.\\\\nIndia Global trends in Solar Power 51 Financing for Women in Solar Barriers to Women’s inclusion in the Solar Sector Multiple barriers limit women’s ability to access energy technologies and participate in solar projects and programs. A variety of pervasive factors interact at the individual, institutional, and societal levels that directly limit women’s inclusion in the sector, including: • Gender and Social Norms - Gender norms and intrahousehold dynamics inhibit women’s access to energy technologies. In addition, men are the main purchasers of energy products, even when women are the primary end users; this results in skewed consumer data and products that do not always reflect the needs or preferences of women. As in other sectors, gender norms and bias, as well as broader systemic barriers, limit women’s ability to enter the workforce and obtain funding.\\\\n• Lack of appropriate financing for women-owned and led businesses - Although financial institutions increasingly design gender-neutral policies and services, these tend to reflect the preferences of men. Research shows that women’s businesses may, for example, need a combination of financial and nonfinancial products and services, including training, mentoring, networking, and other advisory services. Specifically, for early-stage off-grid energy enterprises, financing for women to grow and sustain their businesses is limited. Microfinance and traditional rural village savings and loan associations and cooperatives are the most common financing options available to women.\\\\n• Lack of policies that address gender inequality in the solar sector - Gender discrimination in laws, policies, and regulations prohibit and inhibit women from accessing the benefits of energy services and from actively participating in the sector. The 2021 Women, Business and the Law (World Bank, 2021) reports that 75 countries limit women’s property rights in some form, and various legal barriers prevent women from working in specific sectors and occupations. Renewable energy policies and frameworks can be catalytic in introducing labor conditions that are conducive to women’s active participation in the sector, although even when energy frameworks include some gender considerations, women are mostly characterized as potential beneficiaries rather than as agents of change.\\\\n▪Energy equity aims to ensure that disadvantaged communities have equal access to clean energy and are not disproportionately affected by pollution. It requires fair and distribution of benefits in the energy system through intentional design of systems, technology, procedures and policies.\\\\n▪Committing to equity in clean energy programs, policies, and investments can improve and expand clean energy services and technologies for marginalized groups while creating more just processes, outcomes, and systems.\\\\n▪Clean energy services can reduce energy costs, create jobs, and promote the health, safety, and well-being of residents.\\\\n▪Policymakers, utilities and other decision makers can address these energy burden disparities through clean energy policies and programs.\\\\n▪Equitable energy policies often improve energy access and affordability, procedural justice, economic participation and community ownership, and health and environmental impacts.\\\\nSolar & Energy Equity Global trends in Solar Power 52 Way Forward Despite the ongoing expansion of renewables around the world, significant challenges remain which include: • Certain renewable power markets follow a boom-bust cycle due to short-term, unpredictable policy making, as evidenced in 2021 by the surge in offshore wind power in China to meet a feed-in tariff deadline and by the collapse of Vietnam’s solar PV market after two years of generous incentives.\\\\n• Transmission bottlenecks and network expansion in some countries have held back the deployment of renewables.\\\\n• Unstable supply chains (related to a concentration of technology suppliers in few countries) can delay projects and raise costs, leading to unpredictable price rises that put pressure on the economic validity of projects.\\\\n• Local capacity and knowledge gaps remain a challenge during the construction and operation phases in emerging markets and remote locations.\\\\nFuture editions of the “Global trends in Solar power” report will aim towards capturing the global and regional level insights related to the solar sector which are quintessential in further reinforcing the analysis for ISA Member countries. Also, in the upcoming editions, greater emphasis will be given to include the best and emerging practices in the area of policy, technology and market eco-system in the ISA member countries.\\\\nInclusion & analysis of new chapters pertaining to the Solar market ecosystem, desired key trends in the global solar market related to digital and emerging technologies etc are some other additional initiatives to enhance the outcomes and outreach of Global trends in Solar Power.\\\\nEfforts towards addressing the development of solar sector as mentioned above, should be addressed at a faster pace, to facilitate the deployment of solar energy and to achieve the transition to a net-zero economy.\\\\n6 Global trends in Solar Power 53 References 1.

From increased solar PV and onshore wind deployment to advancing green technologies such as offshore wind power, floating solar, batteries, EVs and green hydrogen, Asia will again lead the global decarbonisation journey. The initial signs are that this won’t fly under the radar of energy transition investors, who will continue to look favourably toward the Asia Pacific as the preferred region for their investments. The Top Renewable Energy Trends in Asia in 2025 In 2025, China is likely to surpass its target of having 1,200 GW of clean power by 2030, reaching 1,500 GW, while its CO2 emissions have already peaked or will do so in 2025. Projections reveal that between now and 2030, China will account for nearly 60% of all renewable energy capacity installed worldwide. By the decade’s end, the country will have over 50% of the world’s renewables. Alongside India, it will be the engine behind the accelerated deployment of renewables. Between now and 2030, clean energy is expected to roll out at three times the pace of the previous six years. Furthermore, China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels today exceeds 80%. The country is also home to the world’s top 10 solar PV manufacturing equipment suppliers and has been instrumental in bringing down costs worldwide for solar PV. According to the IEA, the world will almost completely rely on China to supply key building blocks for solar panel production through 2025. When it comes to wind, the Global Wind Energy Council finds that the onshore wind capacity in the APAC region could more than double to 1,084 GW by the decade’s end. Not only will ground-mounted solar PV and onshore wind energy capacity be deployed faster than ever in Asia, but accompanying green technologies will make major leaps. 1. Offshore Wind According to the Global Wind Energy Council, the Asia-Pacific region possesses some of the most attractive onshore and offshore wind resources globally and could play a pivotal role in the global energy transition. By 2030, over 122 GW of new capacity could come online, taking the cumulative regional total to 162 GW. As with other green technologies, China will be by far the largest onshore and offshore wind market. By 2030, China will have around 130 GW of offshore wind. Japan and South Korea have already held offshore wind auctions, with the first awarded projects to come online from 2026, deploying 4 and 6 GW, respectively. Vietnam is working towards deploying 6 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 70–91.5 GW by 2050. From 2024 to 2030, operational offshore wind capacity in APAC is set to increase sixfold. APAC Offshore Wind Supply Chain Potential by 2030. Source: GWEC Currently, APAC’s wind turbine supply dwarfs that of manufacturers from the rest of the world. Furthermore, most of the demand comes from within the region, positioning the local industry for significant growth in the upcoming years. However, to maximise the region’s potential and meet the 2030 targeted wind installations, GWEC recommends that APAC governments prioritise scaling up regional supply chains. Crucial on that front would be increasing the public support for supply chain capacity building outside of auctions to boost resilience and ease the price pressure on developers. According to experts, international collaboration to scale up the floating wind supply chain would also be of great importance. South Korea’s Floating Wind project, which will consist of between 60 and 100 wind turbines, with power expected in 2028, and Doosan Enerbility’s Changwon plant are shining examples of global cooperation in the field. 2. Floating and Rooftop Solar Panels Wood Mackenzie projects that APAC will be home to nine of the top 10 global floating solar markets. Together, they will account for 57 of the 77 GW of installed floating solar capacity globally by 2033. India, China and Indonesia will be the three largest markets. In 2024, China already opened the world’s largest open-sea floating solar project – a 1 GW power plant in the Shandong Province. However, growth is also expected in Southeast Asian countries. Rystad Energy expects floating PV to play a key role in Southeast Asia’s solar expansion, accounting for 10% of the region’s total solar capacity by 2030.

footerShare of energy consumption from renewable sources in EuropePublished 16 Jan 2025ShareRenewable energy sources represented 24.5% of the European Union’s final energy use in 2023. The share is estimated to have increased by one percentage point since 2022, still largely driven by strong growth in renewable electricity supply. The share is also amplified by a small 2023 reduction in non-renewable energy consumption. Meeting the new minimum EU target of 42.5% for 2030 will demand doubling the rates of renewables deployment seen over the past decade and a deeper transformation of the European energy system.Figure 1. Progress towards renewable energy source targets for EU-27Please select a resource that has a preview image available.Renewable energy sources (RES) have multiple benefits for society compared with fossil fuels, such as\\xa0mitigating climate change, reducing the emission of air pollutants and improving energy security. The revised\\xa0Renewable Energy Directive\\xa0increases the binding target from 32% to a minimum 42.5% share of renewables in EU energy consumption, with the aim of achieving 45%. Each Member State will contribute to this common target. Targets were not introduced for individual countries.At 24.5% in 2023, the share of renewables in the EU increased by one percentage point from 2022. It represents a historical high following the adoption of important EU legal frameworks to speed up the clean energy transition. The Fit-for-55 EU policy package and the higher EU ambitions introduced by the RepowerEU plan are especially relevant in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The 2023 renewable energy share also signals a return to higher\\xa0growth rates\\xa0of renewables after a dip in 2021 (figure 1). In absolute values, the gross final consumption of renewables grew by almost seven million tonnes oil equivalent (Mtoe) between 2022 and 2023, driven by a substantial increase in solar power generation (by 19.7%) and wind power (by 9.3%). Non-renewables saw a reduction of 3%, mainly linked to lower utilisation of coal for energy supply. This increased the relative share of renewables in the EU gross final energy consumption.The electricity system continued to lead decarbonisation efforts in 2023, with 45.3% of all EU power generated from renewable sources. It was followed by heating and cooling (26.2%) and transport (10.8%), where renewable energy from heat pumps (+13%) and renewable electricity consumption in road transport (+53%) increased notably, compared with 2022. Solid, gaseous and liquid biomass\\xa0resources together formed the largest category in 2023, totalling half of all renewable energy consumption. This may have implications for terrestrial carbon sinks, biodiversity and air pollution if the demand for biomass continues to increase. Solid biomass is most widely used in residential and district heating, electricity generation and industry. Gaseous biomass (biogas) is typically burned to produce heat and power, while liquid biomass fuels (biofuels) are mainly used directly or blended with gasoline and diesel in transport. Wind (17%), hydro power (13%) and solar photovoltaics (9%) were the other three largest renewable energy sources, followed by heat pumps and liquid biofuels (both with an 8% share of all renewable energy use). Other renewables sources\\xa0were biogases, renewable waste, geothermal and solar thermal.Looking at the longer-term trends, the RES share more than doubled between 2005 and 2023. This was driven by dedicated policies and support schemes, as well as increased economic competitiveness of renewables. The increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% over the last decade (or 5.0% since 2005).Modelling from the\\xa0IEA\\xa0and\\xa0Ember\\xa0indicate that reaching the new minimum target for 2030 of a 42.5% share of renewables might be feasible if fast and decisive action is taken to promote renewables and reduce energy consumption. The trends in the deployment of solar photovoltaics and heat pumps also provides optimism. However, reaching the target will require a challenging CAGR of 8% on the EU renewables share until 2030, which is more than double the observed rate over the past decade. Considering this, the EU is not likely to meet its target, unless it allocates more resources for a deep transformation of the energy system.Figure 2. Share of energy from renewable sources, by countryPlease select a resource that has a preview image available.Sweden, Finland and Denmark had the highest RES shares among Member States in 2023 due to strong hydro industries (Sweden and Finland), wind power and wide use of solid biofuels for district heating. By contrast, Luxembourg and Belgium reported the lowest deployment of renewables, of 12% and 15% in 2023.Over time, Denmark, Sweden and Estonia have experienced the highest growth in RES share...\", \"status\": \"success\"}', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_DAvn92GlWbJrIDtMEZ0yfxcl'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'description': 'A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results.
